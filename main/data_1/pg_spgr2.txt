but is less desirable than grass and alfalfa during the 
fall (Rumbaugh and others 1993).  
 
Pollinator habitat:  Globemallow species flower in 
the spring and are known to attract numerous species 
of native bees including Diadasia, Agapostemon, 
Halictus, Melissodes and Calliopsis (Pendery and 
Rumbaugh, 1986). Some bee species are specialists 
which only forage pollen and nectar from 
Sphaeralcea and related taxa of the mallow family 
(Tepedino, 2011).  
 
Range revegetation: Gooseberryleaf globemallow is 
well adapted to arid to semi-arid environments in the 
western United States. It establishes from seed and 
also by transplanting and has been shown to be 
competitive against cheatgrass and other winter 
annuals (Stevens and Monsen, 2004). 
 
Ethnobotanical: Hopi Indians used boiled or chewed 
roots for bowel problems and for broken bones 
(Colton, 1974).

Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Description 
General:  Mallow family (Malvaceae).  
Gooseberryleaf globemallow is a native perennial 
forb to subshrub with few to many stems arising from 
a deep, branched woody caudex. Mature plants range 
from 35 to 75 cm (14 to 30 in) in height. This species 
is morphologically diverse. Stems and leaves can be 
white to gray with dense stellate hairs, or green and 
sparsely hairy. The leaves are typically 3 to 5 lobed 
with the lobes distinct to the base, the blades 1.2 to 5 
cm (0.5 to 2.0 in) long. Flowers are orange or rarely 
rose pink with 5 petals ranging from 8 to 18 mm (0.3 
to 0.7 in) in length. The fruit is a schizocarp with 8 to 
20 carpels (Welsh and others, 2003). 
 
Distribution:  Gooseberryleaf globemallow is native 
to western North America from Idaho south to New 
Mexico and west to arid regions of Washington, 
Oregon and California. For current distribution, 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 

Habitat:  Gooseberryleaf globemallow occurs in cool 
and warm desert shrub communities in western North 
America. It is commonly found in salt desert shrub

Alternate Names 
Currant-leaf globemallow 
 
Uses 
Forage:  Globemallow species are grazed 
opportunistically by pronghorn antelope, deer, elk, 
and bighorn sheep (Beale and Smith, 1970; 
Rumbaugh and others, 1993). The leaves, fruits and 
seeds are eaten by rodents, rabbits and birds (Pendery 
and Rumbaugh, 1986). Palatability of globemallow 
species has been rated desirable to preferred in spring 
and summer for sheep and antelope and desirable in 
spring, summer and fall for cattle, horses, deer and 
elk (Ogle and Brazee, 2009). Globemallow is 
preferred over grass but not alfalfa during the spring, 

 

shadscale and saltbush plant communities. It is also 
found in the drier portions of sagebrush and pinyon-
juniper plant communities (Holmgren and others, 
2005; Welsh and others, 2003). 

Adaptation 
Plants can be found in open deserts, playas, hillsides 
and canyons from 800 to 2,300 m (2,600 to 7,500 ft) 
elevation in areas receiving 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 
inches) of annual precipitation. Gooseberryleaf 
globemallow is often found as an early to late seral 
species in open or disturbed sites. The species is 
adapted to clay to gravel soils, and is moderately 
alkali (saline to sodic) tolerant (Pendery and 
Rumbaugh, 1986). 

Establishment 
Gooseberryleaf globemallow should be planted with 
a drill or broadcast into a weed-free seed bed at a rate 
of 2.2 kg pure live seed (PLS) per ha (2 lbs PLS per 
acre) and at a depth of 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.25 in) 
(Ogle and others 2011; Rawlins and others 2007).  
When planted in a mix, the seeding rate should be 
adjusted according to the proportion of this species in 
the mix.  The seed has an impermeable seed coat and 
should be scarified using boiling water or other 
treatment prior to planting if a high initial 
germination rate is desired. 

Management 
Gooseberryleaf globemallow should be used as a 
minor component of restoration seed mixtures. 
Management strategies should be based on the key 
species in the established plant community. Grazing 
should be deferred on seeded lands for at least two 
growing seasons to allow for full stand establishment. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Rust (Puccinia sherardiana) and powdery mildew 
(Leveillula taurica) have been observed on 
gooseberryleaf globemallow (Briere and Franc, 1998; 
Sampangi and others., 2010). 

Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns 
associated with this species. 

Seed and Plant Production 
Harvested seed can be cleaned by processing with a 
brush machine or hammer mill and air screening 
equipment. There are approximately 1,100,000 seeds 
per kilogram (500,000 seeds per pound) (USDA 
NRCS, 2011).   
 
Gooseberryleaf globemallow, like other members of 
the Sphaeralcea genus, has an impermeable seed coat 
which functions as a physical dormancy mechanism 
and prevents water uptake (Kildisheva, 2011).  Little 
improvement in germination has been obtained with 
cold-moist stratification alone. Smith and Kratsch 

 

 

(2009) report significant germination improvements 
for globemallow seed following a combination of 
scarification (nicking the seed coat) and a 6 week 
cold stratification. Smith and Kratsch (2009) suggest 
that Sphaeralcea may exhibit a double dormancy 
with physical and physiological mechanisms.  
 
Germination of Munro’s globemallow (S. munroana), 
thought by some to be the same species or a sub-
species of gooseberryleaf globemallow, was 
significantly improved with scarification (87 %), a 
combined scarification and 24 hr soak in distilled 
water (93 %), and scarification plus a 24 hr soak in 
100 ppm gibberellic acid (GA3 ) (88%) compared to a 
non-treated control and treatments of soaking in GA3 
without scarification (<20 %) (Kildisheva, 2011). 
 
Mechanical scarification treatments can damage 
globemallow embryos. Page and others (1966) and 
Roth and others (1987) suggest Munro’s 
globemallow seeds lost viability during mechanical 
scarification in a sandpaper-lined rotating drum, 
regardless of treatment duration.  
 
Chemical scarification treatments have been shown 
to be effective for some globemallow species (Page 
and others., 1966; Sabo and others., 1979; Roth and 
others., 1987; Smith and Kratsch, 2009).  
Submergence in 18 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) for 10 
min significantly increased germination of two 
accessions of gooseberryleaf globemallow (69 % and 
62 %) compared to 14 and 32% for the control.   
Jones and Whittaker (2011) found immersing 
globemallow seed in boiling water improved 
germination, and stratification did not provide a 
further increase in germination.  Kildisheva (2011) 
compared the effects of a10 second submergence in 
boiling water, tumbling with aluminum oxide, 
burning, heat application at 80° C for 1 hr, and the 
combination of burning and heating.  Seeds subject to 
the boiling water treatment reached the highest 
cumulative germination (49%); while germination of 
seeds subject to the other treatments did not exceed 
20%. 
 
Globemallow fruit ripen indeterminately. Pendery 
and Rumbaugh ( 1993) recommend harvesting seed 
when the lowest globes start to split and the majority 
of fruit is just ready to open. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
Common wildland collected seed is available through 
commercial sources. There are currently no 
commercial releases of gooseberryleaf globemallow.
