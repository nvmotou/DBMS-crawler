valuable forage especially during late fall and early winter 
after more desirable forage has been utilized 
(Tirmenstein, 1999). Palatability and usage vary between 
subspecies of yellow rabbitbrush (McArthuer et al., 
1979).  
 
Yellow rabbitbrush provides cover and nesting habitat for 
sage-grouse, small birds and rodents (Gregg et al., 1994). 
Black-tailed jackrabbits consume large quantities of 
yellow rabbitbrush during winter and early spring when 
plants are dormant (Curie and Goodwin, 1966). 
 
Yellow rabbitbrush provides late summer and fall forage 
for butterflies. Unpublished field reports indicate 
visitation from bordered patch butterflies (Chlosyne 
lacinia), Mormon metalmark (Apodemia mormo), 
mourning cloak (Nymphalis antiopa), common checkered 
skipper (Pyrgus communis), and Weidemeyer’s admiral 
(Limenitis weidemeyerii). 
 
Restoration: Yellow rabbitbrush is a seral species which 
colonizes disturbed areas making it well suited for use in 
restoration and revegetation plantings. It can be 
established from direct seeding and will spread via 
windborne seed. It has been successfully used for 
revegetating depleted rangelands, strip mines and 
roadsides (Plummer, 1977).

Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current

Description 
General:  Sunflower family (Asteraceae). Yellow 
rabbitbrush is a low- to moderate-growing shrub reaching 
mature heights of 20 to 100 cm (8 to 39 in) tall. The stems 
can be glabrous or pubescent depending on variety, and 
are covered with pale green to white-gray bark. The 
leaves are narrow and linear to oblong 1 to 6 cm (0.4 to 
2.4 in) long and 0.5 to 8 mm (0.02 to 0.3 in) wide and 
often appear twisted. The flowers heads are borne in 
numerous compact to open terminal cymes. The flower 
heads are 5 to 7.5 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long and 2 to 4 mm 
(0.08 to 0.16 in) wide with glandular or pubescent bracts. 
The individual flowers are yellow 4 to 6 mm (0.16 to 0.25 
in) long, producing a 4 mm (0.16 in) long, hairy achene 
(Welsh et al., 2003).  
 
There are five recognized varieties of yellow rabbitbrush 
including varieties planifolius, lanceolatus, puberulus, 
axillaris and viscidiflorus which can be distinguished by 
leaf morphology, stem pubescence and distribution. Flora

Uses 
Wildlife and livestock: Yellow rabbitbrush is browsed by 
large game and livestock. It is considered desirable fall 
forage for cattle, sheep, horses, elk and antelope, and 
spring forage for deer (Ogle and Brazee, 2009). It is a 

 

of North America (1993+) provides a taxonomic key for 
the separation of varieties. 
 
Ethnobotany 
Yellow rabbitbrush has been used by a variety of Native 
American peoples. Paiute Indians used yellow rabbitbrush 
to treat colds and coughs (Kelly, 1932), and the Hopi 
Indians used yellow rabbitbrush as a dermatological aid 
(Fewkes, 1896). The Gosiute and Paiutes used the latex 
from the roots as a chewing gum (Chamberlin, 1911; 
Mahar, 1953). Hopi and Navajo people used the flowers 
to create orange and yellow dye (Colton, 1974; Elmore, 
1944). 
 
Distribution:  Yellow rabbitbrush is native to western 
North America. It has been found from British Columbia, 
south to California and east to Nebraska, Colorado, 
Montana and New Mexico. For current distribution, 
please consult the Plant Profile page for this species on 
the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  Yellow rabbitbrush occurs in desert to semi-
desert habitats in western rangelands. It is commonly 
associated with other rabbitbrush species (Chrysothamnus 
and Ericameria spp.) and sagebrush species (Artemisia 
spp.). Other associates include broom snakeweed 
(Gutierezi sarothrae), shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), 
and winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata). Yellow 
rabbitbrush can also be found growing in pinyon-juniper 
(Pinus-Juniperus woodlands). Yellow rabbitbrush and 
other rabbitbrush species are often subdominant in 
sagebrush communities with rabbitbrush densities quickly 
increasing after heavy disturbance and then decreasing 
with time as sagebrush densities increase (Young and 
Evans, 1974).

Adaptation 
Yellow rabbitbrush is adapted to coarse to medium well-
drained soils in areas receiving (7 to 24 in) mean annual 
precipitation. It has fair salt tolerance and will grow in 
soils with a pH range 7.0 to 8.5 (USDA-NRCS, 2012). It 

 

 

is found at middle to high elevations from 800 to 3,350 m 
(2,600 to 11,000 ft) (Hitchcock and Cronquist, 1973). 

Establishment 
Yellow rabbitbrush does not exhibit dormancy and do not 
persist in the soil seed bank (James et al., 1991). Field 
establishment of yellow rabbitbrush is typically achieved 
with nursery grown plants or with fall dormant seedings. 
Seed should be broadcast or shallow drilled to no more 
than 3 mm (0.125 in) depth. The pure stand seeding rate is 
0.5 lb/ac. For rangeland seedings the recommended rate in 
mixes is approximately 1/40 of a pound PLS per acre 
(Ogle et al., 2011). There are approximately 733,000 
seeds/lb (USDA-NRCS, 2012). Bareroot and 
containerized materials can be transplanted in the fall or 
spring (McArthur and Stevens, 1994). 

Management 
Yellow rabbitbrush increases with overgrazing and is 
difficult to completely control (Whitson et al., 1996). It is 
susceptible to 2,4-D during periods of active growth and 
available moisture when herbicides will be translocated 
through the tissues to the dormant buds in the crown 
(James et al., 1991). Top removal practices such as 
mowing and burning are ineffective due to yellow 
rabbitbrush’s ability to resprout from crown buds (James 
et al., 1991). If management objectives are to reduce 
yellow rabbitbrush, fire treatment is not generally 
recommended as it may result in the species becoming 
dominant. 

Pests and Potential Problems 
Mature yellow rabbitbrush plants are susceptible to 
infestations of the larvae of hairy yellow-marked 
buprestid (Acamaeodera pulchella) which bore tunnels 
through the stems resulting in plant death (Young and 
Evans, 1974). 

Environmental Concerns 
Yellow rabbitbrush will spread and can become weedy 
under high grazing and disturbance (Whitson et al., 1996). 

Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective. 

Seeds and Plant Production 
Seed can be collected by hand with racquets and hoppers, 
or mechanically with vacuum type harvesters, flail vacs 
and other seed strippers. Yellow rabbitbrush seed is 
difficult to clean and low purity levels are common in 
seed lots. Jorgensen and Stevens (1994) list acceptable 
purities of 10 to 15 percent. Long term seed storage of 
yellow rabbitbrush has been problematic. Seed viability of 

rubber rabbitbrush dropped from 80 to 14% when stored 
under dry storage conditions from the second to fifth year 
in storage (James et al., 1991).
