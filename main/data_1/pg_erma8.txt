to erect stems arising from a branching caudex. 
Mature plants reach up to 18 cm (7 in) in height. The 
lowest leaves are 2 to 5 cm (0.75 to 2 in) long and 3 
to 8 mm (0.12 to 0.31 in) wide. The leaves become  
 
reduced going up the stem. Leaves and stems are 
covered with spreading hairs. The stems bear 1 to 3 
flowers with 12 to 20 white to pinkish rays. The 
flower centers are made of several yellow to orange 
disk flowers. The fruit is a 2 nerved, hairy achene 
with a pappus of 13 to 25 barbellate bristles (Welsh 
et al., 2003). 

Distribution:   
Maguire daisy populations have been identified in 
Emery, Wayne and Garfield Counties in southeastern 
Utah. The range of the species is currently estimated 
at 1,010 km² (390 mi²). (USDI-FWS, 2008). 
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  
Maguire daisy occurs on mesa tops in dwarf 
mountain mahogany-slickrock plant communities in 
association with pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine and 
slickrock pockets in mesic canyon bottoms, mountain 
shrub and intermittent riparian communities. All 
known populations exist between 1,500 and 2,600 m 
(4,900 to 8,500 ft) in elevation. The species occurs 
primarily on Navajo Sandstone formations but is also 
found on the Wingate and Chinle formations. 

Adaptation 
Maguire daisy is adapted to arid, sandy sites 
receiving 15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 in) of mean annual 
precipitation. 

Management 
According to the USDI-FWS (2008) the known 
populations of Maguire daisy were stable, and threats 
had been addressed with adequate regulatory 
mechanisms in place.  

Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known pests or potential problems 
regarding Maguire daisy. 

Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns 
regarding Maguire daisy.

Status 
Maguire daisy (E. maguirei var. maguirei) was listed 
as endangered in 1985 (USDI-FWS, 1985). However, 
in 1993, it was determined through DNA analysis 
that varieties maguirei and harrisonii did not merit 
recognition as distinct species (Van Buren, 1993). 
Following this discovery, the now broader E. 
maguirei was reclassified as threatened in 1996 
(USDI-FWS, 1996). In 2008, USDI-FWS proposed 
delisting of the species, citing that populations were 
stable and the species is not currently, and is not 
likely to become an endangered species within the 
foreseeable future (USDI-FWS, 2008). It was 
officially removed from the List of Endangered and 
Threatened Plants, and announced the availability of 
the final post-delisting monitoring plan in 2011 
(USDI-FWS, 2011). 
 
Consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Description 
General:  Sunflower family (Asteraceae). Maguire 
daisy is a perennial, herbaceous forb with spreading 

 

Maguire daisy appears to be an obligate outcrosser 
requiring a pollinator for successful fertilization. 
Monitored populations have been shown to produce 
seed and reestablish at rates suggesting stability. Seed 
germination studies at Flagstaff Arboretum showed 
26, 30, and 24% germination with direct misting, or 1 
or 2 months of stratification (CPC, 2010).
