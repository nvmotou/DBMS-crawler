are white and showy attracting a variety of 
pollinators. Primary pollinators include Apis 
mellifera, Bombus sp., and Osmia sp (Watrous and 
Cane, 2011).  Kremmling milkvetch is of economic 
significance as an indicator of selenium and as a 
potentially toxic plant in rangelands (Brown and 
Shrift, 1982).  The plants have no known agricultural, 
economic, or other human uses known at this time. 

 
Status 
The US Fish and Wildlife Service in (1988) cited the 
Kremmling milkvetch population size at 
approximately 25,000 to 50,000 individuals across 6 
documented occurrences within its 15-mile range, 
predominately in Grand County, Colorado.  
Kremmling milkvetch, because of its limited range, 
small population size, and numerous threats, became 
listed as “endangered” under the Endangered Species 
Act in 1989, with a recovery priority number of 5C, 
indicating a high degree of threat and low recovery 
potential, with conflict from development. A 
significant part of the known range and one 
population was lost when a new reservoir was filled 
on the Muddy Creek in 1995 (Center for Plant 
Conservation, 2011). Recently, a total estimated sum 
of 11,435 individuals were cited from 5 of the 6 
documented occurrences, with one of the occurrences 
not observed in over 20 years (NatureServe, 2011). 
The NatureServe conservation status rank, an 
international effort which rank species on their 
“global” status, denotes Kremmling milkvetch as 
G1/S1- critically imperiled globally and statewide, 
because of its extreme rarity, makes it especially 
vulnerable to extinction.   
 
Description 
General:   
Pea family (Fabaceae).  Kremmling milkvetch, is a 
relatively tall plant with linear leaflets and several 
bright green stems reaching up to 40 inches (100 
centimeters) in height. There are 12—25 white 
flowers, 1 in (2.4 cm) long, per inflorescence, each 
ultimately with stipitate pendulous pods, 1.8 in (4.5 
cm) long.  Astragalus pattersonii  and A. bisulcatus  
are similar species also with a relatively tall growth 
form.  The three species may be separated as follows 
(USFWS, 1992): Kremmling milkvetch is 
distinguished from A. pattersonii by its long, 
pendulous fruits that are laterally compressed, from 
A. bisulcatus by its large, white flowers, and from 
both by its lime-green, linear leaflets (USFWS, 
1989).

Uses 
Kremmling milkvetch (Astragalus osterhoutii) was 
discovered at Sulphur Springs in Grand County 
Colorado in 1905 by George Osterhout. The flowers 

 

 
Distribution:   
Kremmling milkvetch is endemic to a localized area 
near the town of Kremmling in “Middle Park”, 
Colorado.  The current known global distribution 
includes five small and scattered populations within 
an eight-mile radius, occupying an estimated 800 
acres of habitat.  Of the known populations of 
Kremmling milkvetch, approximately 33% occur on 
private land (USFWS, 2009). Please consult the 
USFWS website at www.fws.gov for a map of the 
species occurrence.  
 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  
 
Habitat:  
Kremmling milkvetch occurs on moderate slopes, on 
white shale outcrops of the Niobrara, Pierre, and 
Troublesome Formations in northern Grand County, 
Colorado. The chaparral/shrubland habitat includes 
the following common plant associates: big 
sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata), yellow rabbitbrush 
(Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), broom snakeweed 
(Gutierrezia sarothrae), winterfat 
(Krascheninnikovia lanata), spiny phlox (Phlox 
hoodii), shortstem buckwheat (Eriogonum 
brevicaule), and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum 
smithii),  (NatureServe, 2011). Kremmling 
milkvetch has been described as a likely ice-age relic 
of the southern Wyoming flora that is now limited to 
a small area of habitat (desert badlands) in Middle 
Park, isolated by high ranges of the Rocky Mountains 
(USFWS, 1989). 
 
Adaptation  
Kremmling milkvetch is adapted to grow on highly 
seleniferous, grayish-brown clay soils derived from 
shales of Niobrara, Pierre, and Troublesome 
formations.  Kremmling milkvetch occurs on shaley 
slopes at middle elevations ranging from 7,400 – 
7,900 feet (2,256 – 2,408 meters) (CPC, 2011), 
within the sagebrush parks eco-region (Chapman, 
2006) with an average annual precipitation of 10-16 
inches (US Department of Agriculture, 2006). 

 

Management 
Kremmling milkvetch is threatened by commercial, 
residential, and agricultural property development, 
and the associated new utility installations and access 
roads, reservoir operations and expansion, off-
highway vehicle recreation (Figure 2), oil and gas 
exploration, and livestock grazing.  A loss of 
pollinators and their habitat due to development is 
also a threat to this species. 
 

Pests and Potential Problems 
Blister beetles (Epicauta pennsylvanica) have been 
noted feeding en masse, on the flowers of Kremmling 
milkvetch, particularly affecting populations occuring 
along Muddy Creek (Dawson, 2011 personal 
communication).  Also, larval bruchine beetles of the 
genus Acanthoscelides may feed upon Kremmling 
milkvetch seeds as evidenced by pin-sized emergence 
holes on the seed pods (Cane, 2011 personal 
communication). 

Environmental Concerns 
Kremmling milkvetch is known to accumulate 
selenium at toxic levels in its foliage and is known to 
be a selenium indicator plant (Brown and Shrift, 
1982).  Selenium causes the plant to emit an 
unpleasant pungent odor of garlic or sulfur (rotten 
egg) and at high levels is known to be toxic to 
grazing animals (Brown and Shrift, 1982).    

Seeds and Plant Production 
Seeds of Kremmling milkvetch exhibit physical 
dormancy requiring scarification in order to 
germinate (Dawson, 2011 personal communication). 
Kremmling milkvetch may be mycorrhizal (Haskins 
and Murray, 2009)  and is likely a symbiotic 
dinitrogen fixer with Rhizobium bacteria, as nearly 
all Astragalus species (Paschke, 2011 personal 
communication).  Kremmling milkvetch plants 
produce viable seeds by both outcrossing and self-
pollination, with higher fruit set from self-pollination 
(Karron, 1989).  Low fecundity is commonly found 
in the Astragalus genus, many species persist in 
small, highly restricted populations which are 
endemic to particular geologic formations (Karron, 
1989).
