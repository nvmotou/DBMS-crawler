Gray’s biscuitroot is a host plant for the rare Indra 
swallowtail butterfly (Papilio indra) and is one of 
two plants used as a host by the Anise Swallowtail 
(Papilio zelicaon) (Thompson 1989). 
 
Ethnobotanic 
The tender young stems and roots of Gray’s 
biscuitroot were eaten by the Paiute Indians (Mahar, 
1953). 
 
Medicinal 
Though not proven in clinical trials, this species may 
possess antiviral and antibacterial properties based on 
its relationship to fernleaf biscuitroot (L. dissectum) 
(COSEWIC, 2008). 
 
Status 
Consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
General: Carrot family (Apiaceae). Gray’s 
biscuitroot is a large, perennial, aromatic herb with a 
branched caudex arising from a deep taproot. Mature 
plants can reach up to 60 cm (24 in) tall. The leaves 
are finely divided and parsley like. Each plant bears 
up to 20 naked stems (scapes) which end in an umbel 
with several hundred male or hermaphroditic flowers 
(Thompson, 1984). The petals and stamens are 
yellow, but quickly dry to a whitish color after 
anthesis (Welsh et al., 2003). This species also has a 
distinctive pungent odor. 
 
The seeds are approximately 12 mm (0.5 in) long 
with broad lateral wings. The lateral wings are 
approximately 2 mm (0.08 in) wide and comprise up 
to 2/3 the width of the fruit body (Welsh et al., 2003). 
There are approximately 86,000 seeds/kg (39,000 
seeds/lb) (Barner, 2008). 
 
Plants leaf out in early spring, flower quickly, set 
seed, and then enter summer dormancy. Umbels can 
contain male or hermaphroditic flowers (Thompson, 
1987). Individual plants often do not flower in 
consecutive years (Thompson and Moody, 1985), and 
there can be considerable variation in the number of

Uses 
Wildlife 
Gray’s biscuitroot is grazed  by deer, sheep, mice, 
rats, and rabbits (COSEWIC, 2008). Ogle and Brazee 
(2009) rate it as desirable spring and summer forage 
for cattle, sheep, horses, elk, deer and antelope. 
 
Gray’s biscuitroot is one of the first species to green 
up and flower after snowmelt. This characteristic 
makes this an important species for early spring 
pollinators and other insects. Known pollinators 
include solitary bees and flies. 
 
This species has been identified as an important plant 
species in sage-grouse habitat because of its early  
 

 

flowers produced from one population to the next 
(Thompson, 1987). 
 
The plants live to approximately 7 years of age 
(COSEWIC, 2008), with growth only occurring in 
the spring when moisture is available. Seeds mature 
in July.

Distribution: 
Gray’s biscuitroot occurs in Northwest North 
America, primarily from the Cascade and Sierra 
Nevada to the Rocky Mountains in Washington, 
Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado 
and New Mexico. There are two populations in 
British Columbia, Canada where it is considered a 
threatened species (COSEWIC, 2008). 
 
For current distribution in North America, consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
website. 
 
Habitat:  
Gray’s biscuitroot grows on rocky outcrops, shallow 
pockets of soil in rocks and in open habitat in 
sagebrush, mountain shrub, pinyon-juniper, 
ponderosa pine, and Douglas fir communities.  
 
Adaptation 
This species is adapted to well drained, rocky shallow 
soils at elevations from sea level to 2750 m (0 to 
9,000 ft) (COSEWIC, 2008; Welsh et al., 2003). 
Gray’s biscuitroot is generally found in areas 
receiving 20 to 50 cm (8 to 20 in) mean annual 
precipitation. 
 
Establishment 
Seed can be broadcast or drilled to 3 to 6 mm (1/8 to 
1/4 in) depth into a well prepared, weed-free seed 
bed. This species should be seeded in late fall as a 
dormant planting to allow natural stratification. A 
pure stand seeding rate of approximately 23 lbs/ac 
provides 25 to 30 seeds/ft². Seeding rates should be 
adjusted to the desired percentage for use in a 
mixture. 
 

 
 
Management 
Once established, Gray’s biscuitroot is very 
competitive against weeds due to its long taproot; 
however additional measures to control weeds are 
necessary for seed production.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Gray’s biscuitroot has been known to be attacked by 
the larvae of 2 weevils (Apion oedorhychum and 
Smicronyx sp.) and one moth (Greya subalba ) 
(Ellison and Thompson, 1987). These insect pests are 
known to kill the seed and reduce seed viability. 
 
Herbivory by mammals limits species occurrence and 
spread in Canadian populations (COSEWIC, 2008). 
 
Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns 
regarding Gray’s biscuitroot. 
 
Plant Production 
Seed matures in July to August. Wildland seed is 
easily hand collected. The seed disarticulates readily 
from the stems, and very clean, small collections can 
be made by shaking ripened inflorescences over a 
bag or tarp. Minor screening to remove sticks 
provides excellent purity. 
 
Seed of Gray’s biscuitroot requires a 3-month moist 
chilling to relieve dormancy (Shock, 2011). Scholten 
et al. (2009) observed that greatest embryo 
elongation in the closely releated fernleaf biscuitroot 
(L. dissectum) occurred at temperatures of 3.4 to 5.5° 
C (38 to 42° F). The best germination percentages 
occurred at 3.4 C (38° F) with approximately 16 
weeks of cold/moist stratification. Gray’s biscuitroot 
has exhibited more vigorous, rapid growing seedlings 
than fernleaf biscuitroot and nineleaf biscuitroot (L. 
triternatum).  
 
Large Scale Seed Production 
Shock et al. (2010a) showed a significant positive 
response to irrigation with 10 and 20 cm (4 and 8 in) 
additional water at Ontario, Oregon. Ontario has a 
mean annual precipitation of 24 cm (9.5 in) (U.S. 
Climate Data, 2010), bringing the total received 
water to approximately 46 cm (18 in) for optimum 
seed production. Peak seed yields of over 1590 kg/ha 
(1,400 lb/ac) resulted from 20 cm (8 in) of 
supplemental irrigation. 
 
Seed production fields should be seeded at 25 to 30 
PLS/ft. Rows planted on 75 cm (30 in) centers allow 
for between row cultivation and weed control. When 
using weed barrier fabric, plant seeds into 8 cm (3 in) 
holes at 30 to 45 cm (12 to 18 in) spacing. 
 

 

 

Because Gray’s biscuitroot enters dormancy in early 
summer, foliar herbicide applications of glyphosate 
to surrounding weeds are possible after senescence. 
Always read and follow label and safety instructions 
for each control method.  USDA-NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty any products or control 
methods named, and other products may be equally 
effective. 
 
Two separate studies at Ontario, Oregon produced 
seed in third and fourth growing season (Shock et al., 
2010a and b). Additional techniques are being 
investigated regarding the feasibility of growing 
Gray’s biscuitroot densely in rooting beds prior to 
field establishment. This method would allow a 
grower to sacrifice a much smaller area in the first 1 
to 2 years of plant development while the plants are 
not producing seed. Trials indicate that taproots 
transplanted in autumn establish well (Jensen and 
Anderson, 2010).

Seed can be harvested in production fields via a 
vacuum type or flail vac harvester (Bair and Tilley, 
2010). Seed can be cleaned using an air screen 
cleaner. Purities approximating 100% are achievable 
with minimal effort. 
 
Cultivars, Improved and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
Common wildland collected seed is available from 
commercial sources. There are currently no 
commercial releases of Gray’s biscuitroot.
