areoles are white-wooly with no central spine. There 
are 8 to 14 white radial spines, 1.5 to 4 mm (0.06 to 
0.16 in) long. The flowers are peach to pink with 
petals and sepals looking similar. The fruit is a 
smooth green oval-shaped berry drying reddish 
brown, 7 to 10 mm (0.28 to 0.39 in) long and 8 to 11 
mm (0.31 to 0.43 in) wide. The seeds are 2.5 to 3 mm 
(0.10 to 0.12 in) long and shiny black (Welsh et al., 
2003). 
 
In 1995, Hochstatter proposed that Winkler’s 
pincushion cactus and San Rafael cactus (P. 
despainii) be considered subspecies of Brady’s 
pincushion cactus (P. bradyi), a federally listed 
species from northern Arizona. However; Heil and 
Porter (2004) showed through DNA analysis that P. 
winkleri and P. despainii were more closely allied to, 
but distinct species from mountain ball cactus (P. 
simpsonii). 
 
Distribution: 
There are four known populations of Winkler’s 
pincushion cactus located in north central Wayne 
County, Utah on the eastern boundary of Capitol 
Reef National Park to extreme southwest Emery 
County, Utah. There are approximately 4,500 
documented individuals of Winkler’s pincushion 
cactus in known populations and an additional 20,000 
individuals estimated in unsurveyed available habitat 
(USDI-FWS, 2007). The majority of Winkler’s 
pincushion cactus habitat is located on Federal lands 
managed by USDI-BLM and USDI-NPS. 
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  
Winkler’s pincushion cactus occurs in the galleta-
three awn shrub steppe and salt desert shrub plant 
communities in association with saltbush (Atriplex 
spp.) galleta (Hilaria sp.) and purple three awn 
(Aristida purpurea) (USDI-FWS, 2007). 
 
Adaptation 
This species is adapted to poor quality, saline, fine-
textured substrates of the Dakota, Mancos and 
Morrison Formations from 1,460 to 1,590 m (4,790 
to 5,220 ft) (Welsh et al., 2003). Average annual 
precipitation for the area is 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in) 
(USDI-FWS, 2007).

Uses 
There are no known human or wildlife uses for 
Winkler’s pincushion cactus. Plants are collected 
illegally by cactus enthusiasts. 

Status 
Winkler’s pincushion cactus was listed as a 
threatened species by the USDI Fish and Wildlife 
Service in 1998 (USDI-FWS, 1998). Monitoring data 
indicate that populations are in decline (USDI-FWS, 
2007). 
 
Consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Description 
General: Cactus family (Cactus). Winkler’s 
pincushion cactus is a solitary or sometimes colonial, 
spherical or depressed-hemispheric cactus growing 4 
to 7 cm (1.6 to 2.8 in) tall and 3 to 5 cm (1.2 to 2.0 
in) wide. The tubercles are 4 to 7 mm (0.16 to 0.28 
in) long and 5 to 7 mm (0.20 to 0.28 in) wide. The  

 

Management 
Threats to Winkler’s pincushion cactus include 
illegal plant collecting, off road vehicle (ORV) use 
and livestock trampling, mineral exploration, insect 
infestations, and climate change (USDI-FWS, 2007). 
Conservation measures for this species include 
mitigating the effects of human land use activities on 
known populations, and preventing the illegal 
collection of plants from natural populations. Further 
work surveying suitable habitat and determining 
biological and ecological factors for the species 
distribution are also indicated (USDI-FWS, 2007). 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Winkler’s pincushion is known to be susceptible to 
infestations of insect larvae including the cactus borer 
beetle (Moneilema semipunctatum) (USDI-FWS, 
2007). 
 
Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns 
associated with Holmgren milkvetch. 
 
Seed and Plant Production 
Cuttings of Winkler’s pincushion cactus were 
successfully rooted spontaneously on hormone-free 
media and were subsequently re-established in the 
greenhouse (Clayton et al., 1990).
