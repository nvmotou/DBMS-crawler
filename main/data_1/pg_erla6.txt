Fender’s Blue (Icaricia icarioides fenderi) relies on 
E. lanatum for a source of nectar (Schultz 2001). 
 
Ornamental:  This plant is hardy to Zone 3 and can 
be used in perennial borders, along pathways, and in 
rock gardens and embankments (Rugged Country 
Plants 2011). The Lady Bird Wildflower Center 
(2011) recommends selecting a local ecotype, 
planting several plants in a group, and pruning the 
dead branches. 
 
Rangeland vegetation:  This plant is quick to 
establish and can be used for revegetation and 
diversification of rangeland in a variety of habitats.    
 
Ethnobotanical:  People of the Miwok tribe made a 
poultice of the leaves of this plant and bound them to 
aching parts of the body; the Skagit rubbed the leaves 
on skin to prevent chapping; and the Chehalis used 
the dried flowers as a love charm (Native American 
Ethnobotany Database 2011).

state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Description 
General:  Sunflower family (Asteraceae).  
Eriophyllum lanatum is a native forb or subshrub, 
and may be an annual, biennial, or short- or long-
lived perennial depending on site conditions.  It has a 
multi-branched, erect to spreading form and grows to 
10 to 60 cm (4 to 24 in) tall.  Stems and leaves are 
covered with white hairs.  Leaves are 2.5 to 7.5 cm (1 
to 3 in) long and irregularly divided into narrow 
lobes.  Flowers are solitary, on long peduncles and 
bloom May through July.  The flower head is 4 to 6.5 
cm (1.5 to 2.5 in) wide with golden yellow disk 
flowers and 8 to 12 yellow ray flowers, each 1.5 to 2 
cm (0.6 to 0.8 in) long.  Flower bracts are broad, 
erect and keeled.  Seed is narrow, smooth, has four 
angles and a crown of scales or short pappus.  (Burke 
Museum of Natural History and Culture 2011; 
Hitchcock and Cronquist 1973; Knopf 2001; Lady 
Bird Johnson Wildflower Center 2011; Mooring 
2001). 
 
This plant was first collected by Lewis and Clark 
along the Clearwater River near Kamiah, Idaho, on 
June 6, 1806 (Lewis and Clark Herbarium 2011).  It 
was named Actinella lanata by Pursh and renamed 
Eriophyllum lanatum by Forbes. The genus name

Uses 
Pollinator habitat:  Eriophyllum lanatam attracts 
beetles, syrphid flies, bees, moths and butterflies 
(Mooring 1975).  Butterflies that are known to visit 
this plant include:  orange sulfur, red admiral, 
comma, and skipper (Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower 
Center 2011).  An endangered butterfly in Oregon, 

 

Eriophyllum is from Greek “erion” which means 
wool and “phyllon” which means leaf.  The species 
name lanatum translated from Latin is “covered with 
long woolly hair” (Charters 2011).   

Distribution:  Eriophyllum lanatum is common on 
both sides of the Cascade Mountains from British 
Columbia south to Washington, Oregon and 
California.  Its range extends east to Nevada, Idaho, 
northwestern Utah, western Wyoming, and western 
Montana.  The species is currently divided into 12 
varieties, and among and within varieties there is a 
great deal of genetic and phenotypic variation 
(Mooring 1975).   

A factor contributing to the variation is the presence 
of polyploids.  Mooring (1975) found the 
Eriophyllum lanatum complex contains diploid, 
tetraploid, hexaploid and octoploid populations.   
Diploid populations occupy the geographical and 
environmental extremes of the complex, and 
polyploid populations occur where the ranges of the 
varieties overlap (Mooring 2001).  Polyploidy has 
enabled intervarietal hybridization, and many 
polyploids are intermediate populations that cannot 
be assigned to one particular variety.  California is 
the geographic center of Eriophyllum lanatum, with 
the largest amount of genetic diversity, and where 10 
out of the 12 varieties occur (Mooring 2001).  For 
current distribution of this species, please consult the 
Plant Profile page on the PLANTS Web site. 

Habitat:  This plant is often found growing in rocky 
areas along roadsides throughout its range.  It is also 
found on coulees, bluffs, and canyons, and in dry 
grassland, thickets and forests (Knopf 2001; Lyons 
and Merilees 1995). 

Adaptation 
Eriophyllum lanatum is adapted to areas with dry, 
rocky or sandy soil which receive a minimum of 25 
cm (10 in) annual precipitation at elevations from sea 
level to 3,050 m (10,000ft).  The plant has a high 
drought tolerance due to its white hairs that conserve 
water by reflecting heat and reducing air movement 
across the leaf surfaces (Knopf 2001).   

Establishment 
Plants can be established by seed or seedlings.  Seeds 
should be drilled into a weed-free seed bed in the fall 
at a rate of 3.4 kg PLS per ha (3 lbs PLS per acre) 
and at a depth of 0.6 to 1.25 cm (0.25 to 0.5 in).  
When planted in a mix, the seeding rate should be 
adjusted according to the proportion of the mix.  The 
seed requires a cold and moist period of about 90 
days for optimal germination (Skinner 2007). 
 
To transplant seedlings, the seed should be planted in 
containers in October or November, stratified in cold 
and moist conditions for a period of 90 days, and 

 

 

moved inside to a greenhouse.  The plants should be 
hardened off in a cold frame for 2 to 4 weeks prior to 
transplanting to a prepared field site (Skinner 2007).  
Plants should be spaced 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in) apart 
(Rugged Country Plants 2011).   

Management 
Eriophyllum lanatum is a prolific seed producer and 
will rapidly spread to any surrounding open ground.  
If plant spread is not desired, flower heads should be 
removed prior to seed ripening.   

 

The Forest Service J. Herbert Stone Nursery in 
Medford, OR, reports the biggest challenge to 
production of E. lanatum seed is weed control.  They 
employ a variety of weed control techniques, 
including fumigating the soil prior to planting, 
cultivation, mowing, herbicides and hand weeding 
(Archibald 2006). 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Insects may significantly damage the foliage and seed 
(Mooring 2001).  

Environmental Concerns 
None.

Seeds and Plant Production 
E.lanatum is self-incompatible and therefore requires 
an insect or other vector for pollination (Mooring 
1975).  Cane (2011b) has discovered 
E. lanatum is visited and pollinated by the cavity-
nesting solitary bees Osmia montanum and O. 
californica.  These species are readily managed in 
standard nesting substrates for Osmia bees, and have 
been studied for decades, most recently as pollinators 
of balsamroot. (Cane 2005, Cane 2011a).   

Most Eriophyllum lanatum plants will flower and 
produce seed in their first year of growth.  Seeds 
ripen in July, but ripening date may vary depending 
on elevation.  The seed pappus is reduced to short 

scales, therefore the seed is not wind-borne.  Seed is 
retained on the flower head longer than many other 
Asteraceae species but will shatter within a week 
after ripening (Skinner 2007).  A brush machine or 
hammer mill can be used to process the seed prior to 
cleaning with air screen equipment (Skinner 2007; 
Barner 2009).  A gravity table may also be used to 
remove  the remaining unfilled seed and inert 
material (Barner 2009).  There are about 1,782,000 
seeds per kg (810,000 seeds per lb) (Lambert 2005). 
 
Experiments at the Pullman Plant Materials Center 
demonstrated an extended cold moist stratification 
period is needed to break seed dormancy.  Skinner 
(2007) had 0% germination with no stratification, 
10% germination with 45 days stratification, and 
75% germination with 90 days stratification.  Seed 
stratified longer than 90 days in the fluctuating spring 
temperatures achieved 82% germination.  Some seed 
germinated during stratification, indicating 
germination will occur at low temperatures.  Seed 
stored for 1 year in controlled conditions (5C and 
40% humidity) and sown without pretreatment failed 
to emerge (Skinner 2007).  Mooring (2001) found 
seed viability decreased rapidly after 2 years of 
storage at room temperature, but some seed remained 
viable after 8 years.   
 
To produce seed of Eriophyllum lanatum, the Forest 
Service J. Herbert Stone Nursery sows seedbeds in 
the fall at a rate necessary to achieve 130 plants per 
square meter (12 plants per square foot) (Archibald 
2006).  The seed is sown in bands 1.9 cm (0.75 in) 
deep, 3 cm (1.25 in) wide and 30 cm (12 in) apart 
with a modified Love/Oyjord® drill.  Packing wheels 
are used to press the seed into the soil, and the seed is 
covered with 6 to 8 mm (0.25 to 0.33 in) of sawdust 
which is kept moist with irrigation until fall rains 
begin.  Seed is harvested the following summer with 
a small plot combine, and the remaining plant residue 
is removed with a silage chopper.  Seed yields have 
varied considerably depending on seedlot, growing 
season and age of the crop.  A plot is typically 
harvested for a maximum of 5 years (Archibald 
2006). 

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
None, although seed and seedlings are available from 
several vendors.
