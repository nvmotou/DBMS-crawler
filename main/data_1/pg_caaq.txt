white-tailed deer, and elk (Cowan, 1945; Hansen et 
al., 1990; Schaefer and Messier, 1995; Whitten and 
Cameron, 1980). Water sedge sod forms overhangs 
along streams providing cover for fish (Hansen, et al., 
1994). 
 
Erosion control:  
This species has exceptional value for shoreline 
erosion control due to its prolific rhizomatous root 
system. It has also been used to revegetate mined 
peatlands. 
 
Ethnobotanical:  
Water sedge has been used by several North 
American native peoples for various purposes. The 
Gosiute Indians boiled and ate parts of the plant, 
while Alaska natives ate raw stem bases. The 
Hesquiat Tribe also used the leaves for basket fiber 
(Moerman, 1998). 

Status 
Water sedge is considered a species of special 
concern in Connecticut, endangered in New Jersey, 
and threatened in Pennsylvania (USDA-NRCS, 
2011). 
 
Consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Description 
General: Sedge Family (Cyperaceae). Water sedge is 
a sod-forming perennial grass-like sedge growing 15 
to 100 cm (6 to 40 in) tall. Plants arise singly or in 
groups connected by thick, long rhizomes. The stems 
or culms are triangular in cross section. Leaves are 
borne on the lower half of the stems; the blades are 
1.5 to 5.5 mm (0.06 to 0.22 in) wide and can be 
shorter or longer than the culms. Each culm has a 
leaf-like, 3 to 19 cm (1.2 to 7.5 in) long bract 
subtending the inflorescence. The inflorescence 
consists of 1 to 3 staminate spikes above 2 to 3 
pistillate spikes, often with some androgynous (male 
and female with male flowers on top) transitional 
spikes. The terminal staminate spike is 1 to 3.5 cm 
(0.4 to 1.4 in) long. The pistillate spikes are 1.5 to 4.5 
cm (0.6 to 1.8 in) long and 3 to 5 mm (0.12 to 0.20 
in) wide. Each fruit (achene) is subtended by a 
lanceolate to rounded, blackish or black purple scale, 
shorter to longer and narrower than the perigynia. 
The scale has a green to pale brown midrib. Each 
achene is enclosed in a perigynium, a leathery sack-

Uses 
Grazing/rangeland/pasture:  
Water sedge stays green late into the summer 
providing good forage when other food sources have 
gone dormant. Livestock utilization of water sedge is 
dependent on the time of year and other available 
forage. It is listed as good palatability for cattle, 
domestic sheep, and horses with fair nutritional value 
(Hansen et al., 1990; Kovalchik and Clausnitzer, 
2004). 
 
Wildlife:  
Water sedge is grazed by numerous species of geese, 
swans and other waterfowl. The vegetation also 
provides a source of cover (Derksen, et al., 1979).The 
plants are eaten by bison, caribou, mule deer,  

 

like structure. The perigynia are 2 to 3.3 mm (0.08 to 
0.13 in) long. The achenes are lenticular (lens 
shaped) with 2 stigmas (Welsh et al., 2003).

Distribution 
Water sedge is a circumboreal species. In North 
America it occurs from the Arctic to as far south as 
California, Arizona, New Mexico and Virginia 
(USDA-NRCS, 2011). 
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  
Water sedge occurs in wet and boggy meadows, 
stream banks, and pond and lake margins. It is often 
found with other wetland herbaceous species 
including other sedges (Carex spp.), rushes (Juncus 
spp.), and bulrushes (Schoenoplectus spp.). It can be 
found in large monoculture stands and also in open 
areas of riparian sites associated with willows (Salix 
spp.), cottonwood (Populus spp.), and birch (Betula 
spp.) plant communities. 
 
Adaptation 
Water sedge can be found from sea level to over 
3,350 m (11,000 ft) in elevation. It is adapted to 
temperatures reaching as low as -20° C (-4° F). Water 
sedge grows in sites where the water table is near the 
soil surface in the toe and bank zones, and can 

 

 

withstand 1 to 2 months of submersion. This species 
is shade intolerant; it likes open disturbed areas. 
Depending on the site, water sedge can act as a 
pioneer or climax species. 
 
Management 
The soil should be kept saturated with no more than 
2.5 to 5.1 cm (1 to 2 in) of standing water until the 
plants are well established and the aerenchymous 
material (the above ground biomass) is about 0.3 m 
(12 in) tall. Fluctuating water levels during the 
establishment period may speed establishment and 
spread.  Water levels can be managed to enhance 
rhizome spread and to control weeds. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known pests or other problems 
associated with water sedge. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns relating 
to water sedge. 
 
Seed and Plant Production 
Water sedge is wind pollinated and primarily cross 
pollinated. Flowers bloom from late May to 
September depending on latitude (Hauser, 2006). 
Reproduction is largely asexual via spreading 
rhizomes. Seedling recruitment occurs, but is 
infrequent. 
 
Collection and Cleaning: Seed is most commonly 
collected by hand. Fruiting heads can be cut from 
stems using shears or a hand scythe. Seed is hard and 
brown when ripe. 
 
Seed is air dried in paper sacks for several weeks 
prior to processing. Seed is removed from stem using 
a hammer mill with a 0.6 cm (0.25 in) screen. Seed is 
then pre cleaned using a small-lot air screen cleaner 
with a 1.80 mm (0.07 in) screen to remove stems and 
other inert matter. The perigynium is then removed 
from the seed using a corrugated rubbing board or 
hammer mill and then re-cleaned with a 1.55 mm 
(0.06 in) screen and light air. Purities of over 95% are 
typical (Tilley, 2010). There are approximately 
450,000 seeds/lb with perigynium still intact, and 
900,000 seeds/lb with perigynium removed.  
 
Greenhouse Plant Production: A 30 day cold/moist 
stratification may be used, but research at the 
Aberdeen Plant Materials Center shows that this is 
not necessary with hot temperatures and high 
moisture levels. For 10 in³ conetainers, place 5 to 25 
seeds on the soil surface and press the seed in for 
good seed-to-soil contact. Seed should not be covered 
with any soil or sand, but kept moist with an 
overhead mist irrigation schedule of 2 minutes/hr 
from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm for the first 30 days. Day 
time greenhouse temperatures range from 32 to 43° C 

(90 to 110° F). Night time temperatures average 
around 30° C (85° F). Grow lights are kept on during 
nighttime hours. 
 
First emergence occurs around 5 to 7 days after 
planting. Full stands (90-100%) are reached in 12 
days. 
 
After full establishment, plants can be fertilized once 
per week with Miracle Grow All Purpose Plant Food 
(15-30-15). After 30 days the irrigation amount 
should be increased to 3 minutes/hr from 9:00 am to 
5:00 pm and grow lights are turned off. Greenhouse 
day time temperatures are reduced to 30 to 32°C (85 
to 90° F). Plants are ready for transplanting in 3 
months. 
 
Establishment 
Wild plants can be collected and transplanted directly 
into the desired project site. Care should be taken not 
to collect plants from weedy areas as these weeds can 
be relocated to the transplant site and the hole left at 
the collection site may fill with undesirable species. 
 
For wetland plantings using greenhouse grown 
transplants or wildings, plant at 15, 30 or 60 cm (0.5, 
1.0 or 2.0 ft) spacing for uniform ground cover in 1, 2 
and 3 years respectively. Seedlings can be hand-
planted or dibbled into moist soil or standing water. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials 
Wild  collected  seed  is  commercially  available,  but 
there are no known releases of water sedge.
