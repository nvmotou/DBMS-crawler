Uses 
Barestem biscuitroot is palatable primarily to sheep but 
grows in such limited quantities that it is hardly an 
important forage species (Hermann 1966). It serves as a 
host plant for the larvae of anise swallowtail butterfly 
(Papilio zelicaon) (Pelini et al 2009). 

Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Description 
General:  Carrot family (Apiaceae). Barestem biscuitroot 
is a perennial forb arising from a stout taproot. The plants 
reach a mature height of 20 to 45 cm (8 to 18 in). The 
 

 

 

Plant Guide

leaves are compound ternate to bi-ternate (dividing into 
groups of three leaflets). The leaflets are larger than the 
finely dissected leaflets common to other biscuitroots and 
very distinctive for the genus. Each leaflet is 2 to 5 cm 
(0.8 to 2 in) long and ovoid to orbicular in outline with 
coarse teeth near the tip. The inflorescence is an umbel 
with 7 to 27, 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long rays. The petals 
are yellow. The fruit is 8 to 12 mm (0.3 to 0.5 in) long; 2 
to 5 mm (0.08 to 0.2 in) wide with 0.5 mm (0.02 in) wide 
wings (Welsh et al 2003). 
 
Ethnobotany 
Barestem biscuitroot was used by numerous Native 
American tribes. It was used as a cold remedy or cough 
medicine by the Cowichan, Kwakiutl, Nitinaht, Saanich 
and Thompson tribes (Turner and Bell 1971; Boas 1966; 
Turner et al 1983; Turner et al 1990). It was eaten raw 
and used like celery by the Okanagon, Atsugewi and 
Paiute tribes (Garth 1953; Perry 1952; Mahar 1953). It 
was also boiled in water and drank as a tea by the 
Thompson tribe (Steedman 1928). 

Distribution:  Barestem biscuitroot is found in western 
North America in British Columbia, Idaho, Utah, 
Washington, Oregon, Nevada and California. For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. 

 

Habitat:  Barestem biscuitroot is found in dry, open to 
sparsely wooded places in lowlands to middle elevations 
(Cronquist et al 1997). It is often found growing in 
sagebrush, pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, and mountain 
brush communities in the Intermountain West (Welsh et 
al 2003). 

Adaptation 
Barestem biscuitroot grows in sandy soils (Walker and 
Shaw 2005) in areas receiving 350 mm (14 in) or more 
mean annual precipitation. 

Establishment 
Biscuitroot species can be broadcast or drill seeded 
(Walker and Shaw 2005). Best results can be obtained 
from dormant fall seedings into a firm, weed-free seed 
bed. Seed should be placed at a depth of 0.6 to 1.2 cm 
(0.25 to 0.5 in) and packed to ensure good seed to soil 
contact.  

Management 
Arrowleaf balsamroot should be used as a minor 
component of seed mixtures.  Management strategies 
should be based on the key species in the established plant 
community.  Grazing should be deferred on seeded lands 
for at least two growing seasons to allow for full stand 

 

establishment (Ogle and others, 2011; Stevens and 
Monsen, 2004). Once established, barestem biscuitroot is 
very competitive against weeds due to its deep taproot. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known pests or potential problems regarding 
barestem biscuitroot. 

Environmental Concerns 
Barestem biscuitroot is native to western North America 
and poses no known environmental concerns. 

Seed and Plant Production 
Flowering occurs from April to June and seed is typically 
harvested in mid July. A cold-moist stratification is 
necessary for germination (Russell 2011). Bartow (2003) 
achieved 90% germination from seed sown into 
conetainers, bagged in polyethylene and put in a cooler at 
(35 to 40 F) for 6 weeks. The conetainers were then 
transferred to greenhouse with temperatures of 70° F 
daytime and 50° F nighttime temperatures. The plants 
were slow to mature. Recommended growing time is 5 
months. Dormant tubers are easily transplanted with high 
establishment success. 
 
New techniques are being investigated regarding the 
feasibility of growing biscuitroot species in rooting beds 
at high densities prior to field establishment. This method 
would allow a grower to sacrifice a much smaller area in 
the first 1 to 2 years of plant development while the plants 
are not producing seed. 

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Seed of barestem biscuitroot is available in limited 
quantities on the commercial market. Larger quantities of 
seed can be grown on a contract basis (Walker and Shaw 
2005).
