Description 
General: Figwort family (Scrophulariaceae). White 
River penstemon is a herbaceous perennial forb with 
multiple stems arising from a woody root crown.  
Mature plants are approximately 15 to 50 cm (6 to 20 
in) tall. Leaves are opposite, linear to linear-
lanceolate, 3 to 17 cm (1.2 to 6.7 in) long and 2 to 23 
mm (0.08 to 0.91 in) wide. The inflorescence is a 
glandular-pubescent, congested raceme bearing pale 
blue to lavender flowers. The flower is comprised of 
five petals fused to form a bilateral tube 
approximately 20 to 22 mm (0.79 to 0.87 in) long. 
The staminode (sterile stamen) is 9 to 10 mm (0.35 to 
0.4 in) long, and the fertile stamens are 10 to 11 (0.4 
to 0.43 in) long. The anther sacs are dark blue, 1.3 to 
2.6 mm (0.05 to 0.10 in) long, and moderately 
bearded with white slender flexuous hairs. The anther 
sacs dehisce nearly the full length, except across the 
center connective tissue (Welsh et al., 2003). The 
fruit is a capsule; 8 to 11 mm (0.31 to 0.43 in) long 
bearing 10 to 20, 2 mm (0.08 in) long seeds (USDI-
FWS, 2010). Flowering occurs in May and early 
June, with fruiting and seed set in late June 
(Lewinsohn and Tepedino, 2007). 
 
Distribution: 
White River penstemon occurs in 15 sites forming an 
arc from Rio Blanco County, Colorado west of 
Rangely, Colorado and westward into southern 
Uintah County, Utah. Total area occupied by known 
populations is approximately 200 acres (USDI-FWS, 
2010). Approximately 70 percent of White River 
penstemon habitat is located on public lands managed 
by the USDI-BLM.  
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  
White River penstemon grows in mixed desert shrub 
and pinyon-juniper communities on sparsely 
vegetated shale slopes. Plants growing in association 
with this species include shadscale (Atriplex 
confertifolia), yellow rabbitbrush (Ericameria 
viscidiflorus), Salina wildrye (Elymus salinus) Indian 
ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides), pinyon pine 
(Pinus edulis) and Utah juniper (Juniperus 
osteosperma) (USDI-FWS, 2010; Welsh et al., 2003).

Uses 
There are no known human uses of White River 
penstemon. It is highly palatable to livestock and 
wildlife (USDI-FWS, 2010). 

Status 
White River penstemon is currently a candidate for 
Federal protection following its official proposal in 
1983.  It is currently protected on USDI-BLM lands 
from development within its habitat. It has a listing 
priority of 9, moderate magnitude of an imminent 
threat, primarily from oil and gas exploration (USDI-
FWS, 2010). 
 
Consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values).

Adaptation 
White River penstemon is endemic to oil shale 
barrens of the Green River Formation in the Uinta 
Basin in Utah and Colorado from 1525 to 2075 m 
(5,000 to 6,800 ft) (USDI-FWS, 2010). The soils are 
calcareous, often white or red, fine textured and 
mixed with shale. The range of this species is found 
in a 13 to 23 cm (6 to 12 in) precipitation zone 
(WRCC, 2011). 
 
Management 
The greatest potential threat to White River 
penstemon is oil and gas development. Habitat 
disturbance from off road vehicle (ORV) use and 
trampling from cattle and sheep may be a factor, but 
these effects have not been sufficiently monitored 
(USDI-FWS, 2010). 
 
White River penstemon is currently a BLM special 
status species, which offers some protection against 
oil and gas development in a portion of its range. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
White River penstemon is palatable to wildlife and 
livestock, and some herbivory has been documented. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Climate change could negatively impact this and 
other species with restricted distributions. 
 
Seed and Plant Production 
Although this species is self-compatible, pollinators 
are required for maximum seed production. The 
flowers are primarily visited by native, solitary bees 
including Anthophora spp., Ceratina spp., Dialictus 
spp., Halictus spp., and Osmia spp. In field surveys, 
Lewinsohn and Tepedino (2007) identified 12 bee 
species visiting White River penstemon, two of 

which were potentially undescribed species. Of the 
ten identified species, only one was considered a 
penstemon specialist.
