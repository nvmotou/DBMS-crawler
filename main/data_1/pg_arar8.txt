Erosion: Low sagebrush frequently grows on arid, sterile 
soils that would otherwise be uninhabited. It provides 
essential cover and root structure for erosion control 
(Francis, 2004).  

Status

noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Description 
General:  Sunflower family (Asteraceae). Low sagebrush 
is a short statured mounded evergreen shrub reaching 
heights of 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 in) with flowering stems 
rising 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in) above the canopy.  The 
trunk is poorly defined with the branches diverging from 
the caudex below the soil surface. The leaves are fan 
shaped, grayish green, 0.5 to 1.5 cm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long 
with 3 lobes at the tip. The flowers are born in heads 
(capitula) in a spicate inflorescence up to 2 cm (0.8 in) 
wide, with 4 to 11 perfect disc flowers per head. The 
leaves on the inflorescence are deciduous and deeply 3-
lobed. The fruit is an achene approximately 0.7 mm (0.03 
in) long (Shultz, 2009). 
 
Low sagebrush can be separated from big sagebrush (A. 
tridentata) by its narrow spicate inflorescence. It differs 
from black sage (A. nova) by having sessile capitula, 
hairy involucres and lobed leaves on the flowering stems 
(Shultz, 2009). 
 
Hotsprings sagebrush is a shorter, dwarf form of low 
sagebrush ranging from 15 to 23 cm (6-9 in) tall. The 
leaves are more deeply lobed than the other subspecies 
and resemble leaves of three-tip sagebrush (A. tripartita) 
with which it is often confused. Morphology and 
distribution suggest a parentage of three-tip sagebrush and 
low sagebrush (Shultz, 2009). 
 
Lahontan sagebrush has longer flower stalks than low 
sagebrush. Mature plants reach 30-90 cm (12 to 35 in) 
tall. It is endemic to northwestern Nevada and adjacent 
portions of Oregon and California. This subspecies is 
believed to be the result of a hybridization of low 
sagebrush and Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata ssp. 
wyomingensis) (Winward and McArthur, 1995). 
 
Alkali sagebrush differs primarily from the other 
subspecies by flowering earlier in the season, from late 
spring to early summer. It can also be distinguished by 
having a middle lobe of the leaves which overlap the two 
lateral lobes (Shultz, 2009).

Uses 
Wildlife/livestock: Low sagebrush is browsed by deer, 
pronghorn, elk and sheep. It is preferred by mule deer in 
winter and spring (Blaisdell et al., 1982). It is rated as 
preferred by pronghorn year round (Ogle and Brazee, 
2009), but is especially utilized during summer in low 
desert scrub communities. Palatability and usage of low 
sagebrush varies by ecotype (Francis, 2004). 
 
Low sagebrush provides cover to small mammals, reptiles 
and birds. Due to its low stature, value as cover for large 
mammals is limited. 
 
 

Distribution:  Low sagebrush and alkali sagebrush are 
found in the Intermountain and Rocky Mountain regions 
in Utah, Idaho Nevada, Oregon Washington, Wyoming, 
northern California, Colorado and western Montana 
(Shultz, 2009). Hotsprings sagebrush occurs in Idaho, 
Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. Lahontan sagebrush is 
known from northwestern Nevada and adjacent areas of 
California and Oregon (Winward and McArthur, 1995). 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  Low sagebrush occurs in a wide variety of 
habitats including valley bottoms, alkali basins, mountain 
slopes, and on dry wind-swept ridges (Shultz, 2009; 
Welsh et al., 2003). This species forms pure stands or can 
be found as a co-dominant species with basin and 
Wyoming big sagebrush, or with black sagebrush. At 
lower elevations it becomes a member of the salt desert 
scrub community with shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), 
greasewood (Sarcobatus spp.) and horsebrush 
(Tetradymia spp.). At higher elevations it is associated 
with pinyon-juniper and mountain shrub communities. 
 
Adaptation 
Low sagebrush in general inhabits dry sterile rocky and 
alkaline clay soils in areas receiving 25 to 70 cm (10 to 26 
in) annual precipitation with a pH of 5.5 to 8.6 (USDA-
NRCS, 2012). Low sagebrush typically grows in sites 
drier than those occupied by big sagebrush taxa, and at 
higher elevation or in areas with more moisture than black 
sagebrush (Tisdale and Hironaka, 1981). Low sagebrush 
will occasionally form a mosaic of patches with big or 
black sagebrush indicating localized soil differences 
(McArthur and Stevens, 2004). 
 
Subspecies arbuscula prefers rocky soils on high valleys, 
mountain slopes, basins and ridges at elevations of 1,500-
3,800m (4,900to 12,500 ft). Alkali sagebrush occurs 
primarily on clay soils in basins and valleys at 1,500 to 
2,800 m (4,900 to 9,000ft). Lahontan sagebrush is 
widespread and occurs in shallow soils in areas receiving 
17 to 35 cm (7 to 14 in) of annual precipitation. 
Hotsprings sagebrush has been found growing on rocky 
igneous soils from 2,200 to 2,800 m (7,200 to 9,000 ft) in 
elevation (Shultz, 2009). 

Establishment 
Low sagebrush can be broadcast or drill seeded in the fall 
into a firm, weed-free seed bed. Seed is small and should 
be planted no deeper than 1.5 mm (0.0625 in). Despite its 
small size, low sagebrush has relatively good seedling 
vigor and can be seeded with forbs (McArthur and 
Stevens, 2004). Low sagebrush should be seeded at 
approximately 0.025 lb/ac for range plantings with a 
target goal of establishing approximately 400 plants per 
acre (Ogle et al., 2011). Seeding rates should be doubled 
when broadcast seeding. When seeding with grasses, 
alternate row seedings are recommended. Seedlings 
establish quickly with rapid root development. Wildings 

 

 

have also been successfully transplanted in spring or fall. 
Low sagebrush has not been successful on sites dissimilar 
to the original collection site. Seedlings establish but do 
not persist or reproduce (McArthur and Stevens, 2004). 

Management 
Plants are susceptible to fire (Britton and Ralphs, 1979) 
however low sagebrush often forms expansive plant 
communities with little understory to carry fire. Low 
sagebrush can invade sites seeded to perennial grasses. It 
grows on exposed sites which are often wintering areas 
for many animals. It is susceptible to 2,4-D (Hormay et 
al., 1962). 

Pests and Potential Problems 
Sagebrush taxa are occasionally susceptible to limited 
outbreaks of the sagebrush defoliator moth, or webworm, 
(Aroga websteri). There are also several microbial and 
fungal pathogens known to attack big sagebrush. 
Although these may inflict serious damage locally, they 
have not been viewed as a great threat to sagebrush 
populations.  

Environmental Concerns 
Low sagebrush is native to western North America. It will 
spread under favorable conditions but does not pose any 
environmental concern to native plant communities. 
 
Seed and Plant Production 
Low sagebrush seed is collected from natural populations. 
The low stature of this species makes it difficult to collect 
seed resulting in high seed prices (McArthur and Stevens, 
2004).  Low sagebrush seed has a low level of dormancy 
and requires a cold stratification period for germination 
(Bonner and Karrfalt, 2008). A ten day chill period is 
recommended for container seeding (Vories, 1981). 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Wildland collected seed is available commercially.
