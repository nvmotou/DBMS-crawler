Gierisch globemallow became a candidate for federal 
protection in 2008 (USID-FWS, 2008). Listing is 
considered warranted; however, higher priority  
 
listing actions have precluded the proposed and final 
listing rules for the species (USDI-FWS, 2010). The 
species has a listing priority of 2 (high magnitude 
with imminent threat). 
 
Consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Description 
General: Mallow family (Malvaceae). Gierisch 
globemallow is a perennial forb growing from a 
woody caudex, with the inflorescence reaching 40 to 
100 cm (16 to 39 in) tall. The stems are often dark 
reddish purple. The leaves are 3 to 5 lobed, bright 
green, and oval shaped in outline. The leaf base is 
often heart shaped. The blades are 1.2 to 4 cm (0.5 to 
1.6 in) long and 1 to 5 cm (0.4 to 2.0 in) wide. The 
flowers are large with orange petals, 15 to 25 mm 
(0.6 to 1.0 in) long (Welsh et al., 2003). 
 
Distribution: 
Gierisch globemallow is known from nine 
populations totaling approximately 60 acres. Eight 
populations are located in northern Mohave County, 
Arizona, and one population is in Washington 
County, Utah. There are between 7,000 and 12,000 
individuals in Arizona, and the Utah population is 
believed to be approximately 5,000 to 8,000 
individuals (USDI-FWS, 2010). 
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  
Gierisch globemallow is found in warm desert shrub 
plant communities of the northern Mohave Desert at 
approximately 1,090 m (3,576 ft) (Welsh et al., 
2003). 
 
Adaptation 
Gierisch globemallow is an obligate gypsophile (a 
plant limited to gypsum based soils) restricted to 
outcrops of the Harrisburg Member of the Kaibab 
Formation. The area receives approximately 13 to 20 
cm (5 to 8 in) of annual precipitation (WRCC, 2011).

Uses 
There are no known human uses of Gierisch 
globemallow. It is palatable to livestock and wildlife, 
especially in drought years when other forages are 
reduced or unavailable (USDI-FWS, 2010). 

Status 

 

 

Gierisch globemallow is threatened by habitat 
destruction due to gypsum mining, and habitat 
degradation from off road vehicle (ORV) use and 
livestock grazing. Habitat for Gierisch globemallow 
continues to be destroyed by gypsum mining, and 
reclaimed sites following mining activities may not 
provide suitable habitat. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Gierisch globemallow is palatable to wildlife and 
livestock. The flowering stems are grazed primarily 
in drought years, reducing seed production and 
recruitment opportunities (USDI-FWS, 2010). 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Climate change could negatively impact this and 
other species with restricted distributions. 
 
Seed and Plant Production 
Life history and germination studies are needed for 
this species. Reproduction, pollination systems and 
seed dispersal mechanisms are unknown.
