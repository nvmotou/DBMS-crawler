Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current

noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Ethnobotany 
The Western Shoshone Indians used shortspine 
horsebrush concoctions as external medicine and used the 
spines as piercing instruments (Howard, 2002). 

Description 
General:  Sunflower Family (Asteraceae).  Shortspine 
horsebrush is a native, deciduous, taprooted, much-
branched shrub 5-12 dm (19-47 in) tall and usually as 
wide as it is tall.  Rhizomes extend from the parent plant 
to about 30 cm (12 in) and it sprouts from the root crown.  
Primary leaves form into spines 5-25 cm (1.97-9.84 in) 
long.  Secondary leaves are green, glabrous, linear-
filiform to spatulate, up to 1 cm (0.39 in) long.  One or 
two bright yellow flowers occur in the axil of the spines.  
The flower heads have 4-6 bracts.  Achenes are very 
densely pubescent with very long, erect, white hairs that 
usually conceal the scanty and fragile pappus.  
Chromosome number is 2n=60.  There are 2 varieties 
recognized, var. spinosa and var. longispina.   
The variety spinosa has recurved spines 0.5-1.5 cm (0.20-
0.59 in) long and is more common while variety 
longispina has spines mostly 1.5-5 cm (0.59-1.97 in) long 
and are mostly straight and is found in the southwestern 
part of the species range (Cronquist et al., 1994; Flora of 
North America, online; Jepson Flora Project, online).

Uses 
Shortspine horsebrush is seldom used by livestock or 
wildlife except in early spring when young shoots and 
buds may be consumed.  Palatability is rated as poor 
(Howard, 2002).  It provides some cover for small 
animals and helps stabilize soil on erodible desert sites 
that are sparsely vegetated.  The species can be poisonous 
to domestic sheep.  It is pollinated by moths, bees 
(including honey bees), flies, beetles, and other insects 
(Howard, 2002). 
 

 

 

Distribution:  Shortspine horsebrush occurs from 
Montana south to New Mexico and west to the Pacific 
coast with the exception of Arizona and Washington.  For 
current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page 
for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 

Habitat:  Shortspine horsebrush is common throughout 
the Great Basin and Mojave Desert but does not occur in 
pure stands.  Isolated individuals or small colonies are 
usually found in saltbush (Atriplex spp.) scrub, low 
elevation sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and pinyon-juniper 
(Pinus-Juniperus spp.) communities.  Common associated 
species in the Great Basin are shadscale (Atriplex 
confertifolia), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata) and 
broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae).  In Nevada 
and California it is commonly found in black greasewood 
(Sarcobatus vermiculatus) – shadscale communities.  It 
also occurs in sagebrush, creosotebush (Larrea 
tridentata), singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla) and 

Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) communities in California 
(Howard, 2002). 

Adaptation 
Shortspine horsebrush occurs on dry, plains, foothills and 
alkali sinks, often on harsh, bare ground with elevations 
ranging from 1,400 to 7,900 feet (426-2408 m).  It grows 
on shallow to deep soils with clay and loam textures and 
pH 6.5-8.2.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 8-
14 inches (203-356 mm).  Flowering occurs from April to 
June (Howard, 2002; PLANTS database). 

Establishment 
Documented establishment of plants from seed is rare.  
Seedlings have been observed on a prescribed fire in 
Oregon (Howard, 2002).  There is no information on 
shortspine horsebrush seed production, viability, and 
seedling establishment.  Seed of Tetradymia spp. may be 
pre-chilled for 4-6 weeks to enhance germination (Young 
and Young, 1992). 

Management 
Because shortspine horsebrush is usually scattered as 
individual plants or in small colonies and is seldom 
utilized by browsers, it has not caused large losses of 
sheep.  However, all species of Tetradymia should be 
considered toxic.  The most toxic species is T. glabrata.  
Sheep that feed on horsebrush species just following or in 
conjunction with consumption of black sagebrush 
(Artemisia nova) or big sagebrush (A. tridentata) and then 
are exposed to bright sunlight may develop a 
characteristic swelling of the lips, ears, and face, 
commonly referred to as “bighead”.  Sheep grazing 
horsebrush in the absence of sagebrush may still die 
without developing bighead.  They suffer from swollen, 
engorged liver with severe fatty changes and low grade 
nephritis (inflammation of nephrons) of the kidney along 
with hemorrhaging of the sub-skin and organ linings.  
Abortions may also occur (Burrows and Tyrl, 2001; 
Panter et al., 2011).  Geographic distribution of the 
different species of Tetradymia generally corresponds to 
distribution of disease caused from plant consumption 
(Burrows and Tyrl, 2001). 
 
Most sheep losses occur during stormy periods when 
sheep change their grazing habits as they are trailed 
through areas of horsebrush when desirable forage is 
lacking.  Hungry/thirsty sheep may also eat toxic amounts 
of horsebrush after they are watered.  The plant is 
especially dangerous during the bud stage (Panter et al., 
2011).  Poisoning has resulted in losses of as many as 
1,000 sheep at a time (Burrows and Tyrl, 2001).  The best 
management advice is to avoid these conditions or 
situations as much as possible. 

Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known pests of shortspine horsebrush. 

 

 

 

Environmental Concerns 
Shortspine horsebrush is a native shrub found scattered or 
in small colonies.  It can spread from seed and rhizomes 
from the root crown.  Increased fire frequencies on 
sagebrush dominated rangelands caused by exclusion of 
wildfire resulting in invasion of annual grasses may also 
favor shortspine horsebrush and other sprouting shrubs 
over sagebrush (Howard, 2002). 

Control 
There is no published information on the control of 
shortspine horsebrush.  Please contact your local 
agricultural extension specialist or county weed specialist 
to learn what works best in your area and how to use it 
safely.  Always read label and safety instructions for each 
control method.  Trade names and control measures 
appear in this document only to provide specific 
information.  USDA NRCS does not guarantee or 
warranty the products and control methods named, and 
other products may be equally effective. 

Seed and Plant Production 
No information on the establishment of shortspine 
horsebrush was found. 

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are no commercial releases of shortspine 
horsebrush.  There are several commercial sources of seed 
and plants (California Native Plant Link, Online).
