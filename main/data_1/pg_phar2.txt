Description 
General: Waterleaf family (Hydrophyllaceae). 
Atwood’s phacelia is a winter annual forb with one to 
several stems. It grows to a height of 36 cm (14 in) 
tall. The leaves are 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 in) long and 
deeply lobed. The inflorescence is a compound, 
scorpioid cyme (curling like a scorpion’s tail), with 
blue to violet bell-shaped flowers with 4 to 6 mm 
(0.16 to 0.24 in) long petals (Welsh et al., 2003). 

Distribution:   
Atwood’s phacelia is known from two locations near 
Tucker, Utah in Utah County. Another population, 
from which herbarium specimens were taken in 1883, 
has not been relocated (USDI-FWS, 1982). 
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  
Atwood’s phacelia is found on shaley-clay slopes in 
pinyon-juniper and mountain brush communities at 
2,015 m (7,050 ft) elevation. The nearby Soldier 
Summit weather station indicates an average of 35 
cm (14 in) of annual precipitation (WRCC, 2010). 

Adaptation 
Atwood’s phacelia is endemic to clay and shale soils 
of the Green River Formation on east and southeast 
facing slopes. The locations of the two populations, 
though high in elevation, are considered to be on 
xeric sites because of the steepness and exposure 
(USDI-FWS, 1982). 

Management 
The existing populations of Atwood’s phacelia are 
located on private property owned by the D&G RGW 
Railroad. The primary threat to the species is habitat 
destruction due to construction activities by the 
railroad company. A major goal in the recovery effort 
is to establish new populations on publically owned 
lands that can receive a higher level of protection 
(USDA-FS, 2010). The objective of the recovery plan 
is to establish a self-sustaining population of 2,000 to 
3,000 individuals on 120 acres of protected habitat, 
and to possibly establish at least one new population 
(USDI-FWS, 1982). 

Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known pests or potential problems 
regarding Atwood’s phacelia.

Uses 
There are no known human uses of Atwood’s 
phacelia. The stems are eaten by rock squirrels 
(USDI-FWS, 1982). 

Status 
Atwood’s phacelia was listed as endangered in 1978 
by the USDI Fish and Wildlife Service (USDI-FWS, 
1978). At the time of listing, the species was known 
from a single population containing nine individuals. 
In 1980 a second population was discovered bringing 
the total number of individuals to approximately 200 
(USDI-FWS, 1982). In 2005, seed collections and 
germination studies yielded 53 potted plants, which 
subsequently produced 11,000 seeds. These seeds are 
to be used in further studies and reestablishment 
ventures (USDA-FS, 2011). 
 
Consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

 

Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns 
regarding Atwood’s phacelia. 

Seed and Plant Production 
Germination occurs in late summer and early fall 
with the onset of summer and fall storms. The 
seedlings form a basal rosette that continues to grow 
beneath snow cover. The flowers bolt after snowmelt 
in May. Seed production has been successful under 
research conditions (USDA-FS, 2010).
