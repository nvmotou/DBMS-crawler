(Sauer et al., 2008) as well as painted bunting (Passerina 
ciris) (Dunkin et al., 2008).  Plum is important to lesser 
prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) for resting, 
escape and thermal cover (Donaldson, 1969).  
 
Livestock: Cattle use plum thickets to escape the summer 
sun and actually gain weight faster when the thickets form 
a usable part of their range (Gardenguides.com, 2010). 
 
Windbreaks: May be used in outside row for ground level 
protection.  
 
Erosion control: It is very effective in stabilizing blowing 
soil. It is also used to stabilize stream banks and gullies 
(Kansas Forest Service, 2010). 
 
Food items: The fruit is used for making wine, jam, and 
jelly.  The search for agricultural diversification has 
rekindled an interest in the domestication and utilization 
of native plums as a high value, specialty crop (Reid and 
Gast, 1993).   
 
Ethnobotanic: Native Americans regularly consumed the 
fruit fresh or dried it for winter (Nature Hills.com, 2010).

Description 
General: Chickasaw plum is a short, thickly branched 
shrub 1 to 3 m (3.3 to 9.8 ft) tall, often forming extensive 
thickets or colonies due to extensive suckering; or small 
tree, height at maturity 4.3 to 7.6 m (14 to 25 ft).  Leaves 
are lanceolate to oblong lanceolate, 0.3 to 6.1 cm (0.8-2.4 
in), 0.16 to 0.3 cm (0.4-0.8 in) wide, acute or short 
acuminate, cuneate or rounded at the base, slender, 
lustrous and glabrous above, strongly trough shaped with 
stalks that bear 2 red glands near the apex with leaf teeth 
finely serrate, tipped with glands or scars of these.  Its 
numerous zigzag twigs are smooth, reddish brown and 
slender.  Younger branches have smooth reddish brown 
bark with large, horizontal lenticels.  Older trees have 
rough, scaly trunk bark.  There are short, side twigs that 
bear flowers and end in sharp points.  Open- pollinated 
and early blooming, March-April, the numerous off-white 
or yellowish white flowers with little fragrance appear 
before the leaves and are less than 20 mm (½ in) across; 
sepals green, no glands on the calyx lobes.  The ripe fruits 
small, 10-20 mm ( ¼ to 1/2in) in size, thin-skinned, red, 
orange-red, or yellow, not glaucous but with a slight 
bloom; stone small, rough, yellowish, and turgid, almost

Uses 
Chickasaw plum was first cultivated in 1874 
(Schopmeyer, 1974).  
Ornamental:  Its white flowers are attractive and fragrant 
in the spring, producing a beautiful flower show.  It 
should be part of any native landscape planting. They are 
maintenance free and attract wildlife (source). 
 
Wildlife: Chickasaw plum is a popular plant for use in 
developing wildlife habitat on sandy soils. The thorny 
thicket is valuable for songbird and game bird nesting, 
loafing and roosting. Various other animals also use it for 
loafing, bedding and escape cover. The fruit is consumed 
by numerous birds and other animals (Kansas Forest 
Service, 2010).  Northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) 
nest in mixed shrub communities composed 
predominantly of Chickasaw plum in Texas (Guthery et 
al., 2005).  There are anecdotal reports of plum providing 
nesting cover for northern bobwhites, brown thrashers 
(Toxostoma rufum), northern mockingbirds (Mimus 
polyglottos) and gray catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) in 
the southeastern U S (Dunkin and Guthery, 2010).  Field 
sparrow (Spizella pusilla), Bell’s vireo (Vireo bellii), and 
loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) also require 
woody plants including Chickasaw plum for nesting 

 

spherical; fruiting in June-August.  Some trees bear edible 
fruits; others have very bitter fruits.  (Bailey, 1939; 
Barkley, 1986; Gleason, 1952; Schopmeyer, 1974)

Distribution: 
The range of Prunus angustifolia is Missouri, west to 
Kansas, southern Nebraska, and extreme southeastern 
Colorado, south to extreme eastern New Mexico, to Texas 
and Louisiana.  It is naturalized east to central Florida, 
north to New Jersey, western Virginia, southern Ohio, and 
Illinois.  It was extensively naturalized and spread by 
Indians in prehistoric times (Little, 1979).  According to 
Sargent (1965), the original native range was thought to 
be central Texas and Oklahoma.  In William Bartram’s 
travels through the southeastern U S in the late 18th 
Century, he wrote that “he never saw the Chickasaw plum 
wild in the forests but always in old deserted Indian 
plantations”.  He hypothesized that the Chickasaw Indians 
brought it from the Southwest beyond the Mississippi 
River (Bartram, 1791).  For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat: 
Chickasaw plum is found in uplands and bottomlands in 
open and wooded-open edge situations (Noble 
Foundation, 2010).  It is a major woody component of 
grasslands in north-central Oklahoma (Dunkin and 
Guthery, 2010).  A shrub native to much of Kansas and 
Oklahoma, it is found growing naturally on sandy prairies 
where it is very effective in stopping blowing sand 
(Kansas Forest Service, 2010). It is often found growing 
along fence rows, roadsides, prairie streams, open areas or 

 

 

thickets, woodlands, and often old home sites 
(Floridata.com, 2010; Stephens, 1973; Steyermark, 1963). 
 
Adaptation 
Chickasaw plum is adapted wherever sandy soils are 
found and performs well when planted on heavier clay-
loam soils (Kansas Forest Service, 2010). 
 
Establishment 
Chickasaw plum is easy to grow in almost any soil, 
except strongly alkaline (Christman, 2008).  It grows 
naturally on sandy soils, but will perform well when 
planted on heavier clay-loam soils (Kansas Forest 
Service, 2010).  It does best in full sun, but grows in 
partial shade (Dunkin et al., 2008).  One-year-old, bare-
root seedlings, 18 to 24 inches tall, are used in plantings.  
Chickasaw plum seedlings are not as vigorous as 
American plum seedlings.  Control of weed and grass 
competition during the first and second years is important 
in survival and early growth (Kansas Forest Service, 
2010).  The plums are drought tolerant once established. 
 
Management 
Protection of older stands during prescribed burns or other 
brush management programs would favor shrub nesting 
birds on grasslands (Dunkin and Guthery, 2010).  Fire can 
set back the above ground growth of Chickasaw plum, but 
does not kill the plants.  Protect the thickets from 
prescribed burning with disk strips.  An advantage of the 
disk strips is that it stimulates the production of forbs and 
legumes as food sources near the thickets, and can cut the 
spreading roots of the sand plums to promote sprout ups 
thereby increasing the diameter of the thicket.  Should fire 
run through the thicket, if it has bare ground, minimal 
damage occurs, otherwise expect 3-5 years of recovery 
time for the over story structure to be recreated.  Cattle 
can also trample the thickets, especially newly planted 
ones.  Rotational grazing and/or fences around the 
thickets should be considered (Quail Unlimited, 2007). 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Insects and disease may occasionally attack this species, 
but are not a serious problem in conservation plantings.  
Rabbits may chew on the bark, but new sprouts will form 
to replace injured stems (Kansas Forest Service, 2010).  
Plum curculio (Conotrachelus nenuphar Herbst) is the 
primary insect pest of Chickasaw plum.  Fruit drop and 
fruit damage caused by this insect must be controlled if 
commercial plantings of plum are to be successful.  Major 
disease problems include brown rot [Monilinia fructicola 
(Wint.) Honey] of the fruit and bacterial leaf spot 
[Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni (Smith) Dye].  Reid 
and Gast (1993) observed that severity of the disease 
increased with fruit yield due to the negative influence of 
fruit production on vegetative growth.  Little natural 
resistance to these diseases is reported.  Chemical controls 
for the major pests of plum are widely available (Reid and 
Gast, 1993).  Consult your local agricultural extension 
specialist for recommended products and application 
rates.

None known 
 
Seeds and Plant Production 
Seed yield is 3.6 to 13.6 kg (8 to 30 lbs) per 45.4 kg (100 
lbs) of fruit. Clean seeds per pound ranges from 770 to 
1,530 with an average of 1,030.  Seed should receive a 
60-120 day moist cold treatment prior to spring sowing.  
Stratify in a sand-peat mixture with seeds thoroughly 
mixed with 1 to 3 times the volume of stratification 
medium between 2.2 and 5°C (36 and 41°F).  Stratified 
seed should be monitored as it can germinate during the 
stratification period.  Plant as early as possible in the 
spring, it is best if a high proportion of the seed has 
cracked stones but the seeds should not have begun 
radical elongation as elongated radicals can be damaged 
in planting.  A pretreatment is not needed for fall sowing.  
Plant seeds 15-20 per 0.3 m2 (sq. ft.) 2.5 cm (1 inch) deep.  
Seedlings can be outplanted as 1-0 stock (Schopmeyer, 
1974).
