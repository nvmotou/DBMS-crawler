The leaves are also reported to have been chewed fresh, 
or dried and used for smoking, mixed with tobacco and 
other dried leaves (Bean and Saubel 1972).  The Luiseno 
Indians reportedly burned the bushes with white sage in 
ceremonial fires before hunting (Sparkman 1908). Early 
Spanish Californians knew the plant as “Romerillo”, and 
regarded it as a panacea, using it in tea for bronchial 
troubles, or as a wash for wounds and swellings (Dale 
1986).  It was also used by early miners in sprays to drive 
fleas from their beds (Dale 1986). 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
General:  Aster Family (Asteraceae).  California 
sagebrush is an aromatic, native, perennial shrub that can 
reach 5 to 8 ft (1.5-2.5 m) in height.  It has a generally 
rounded growth habit, with slender, flexible stems 
branching from the base of the plant.  Leaves are more or 
less hairy, light green to gray in color, usually 0.8 to 4.0 
inches (2-10 cm) in length, with 2 to 4 thread-like lobes 
that are less than 0.04 inch (1 mm) wide, with the margins 
curled under.  California sagebrush blooms in the later 
summer to autumn/winter (depending on locale), and 
inflorescences are long, narrow, leafy and sparse, 
generally exceeding the leaves, with heads less than 0.2 
inch (5 mm) in diameter that nod when in fruit (Hickman 
1993).  
 
Distribution: California sagebrush is found at elevations 
below 2,625 ft (800 m) in central western and 
southwestern California south to northern Baja California, 
Mexico (Hickman 1993).  For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat: This shrub is a dominant component of the 
coastal sage scrub, and an important member of some 
chaparral, coastal dune and dry foothill plant 
communities, especially near the coast (Hickman 1993). It 
grows best on shallow, well-drained soils in hardiness 
zones 7-9 and 14-24 (Norris Brenzel 2001).  
 
Adaptation 
California sagebrush is adapted to summer heat and 
drought, dropping its leaves only under periods of 
extreme drought stress (Perry 1981).  The root system is 
shallow and fibrous, allowing the plant to take advantage 
of early season rains for rapid growth (Hauser 2006).  The 
leaves produce soluble and volatile terpene compounds

Uses 
Landscaping and erosion control: Landscape use is 
usually restricted to slope plantings, especially road scars, 
and revegetation of disturbed areas for erosion control 
(Perry 1981). 
 
Wildlife: Late-successional California sagebrush 
communities provide foraging and nesting habitat for 
many birds, including critical habitat for the federally 
threatened California gnatcatcher and the endemic Bell’s 
sage sparrow, a state-listed species of special concern 
(Hauser 2006).  These communities also support a 
number of amphibians, reptiles and small mammals, such 
as dusky-footed and desert woodrats who preferentially 
feed on California sagebrush (Meserve 1974). 
 
Ethnobotanical: Native Americans in California used the 
leaves of California sagebrush for a number of medicinal 
treatments, including as a poultice for tooth aches or 
wounds, or applied to the back to treat asthma; as a 
decoction taken for menstrual problems, to ease 
childbirth, to ease menopausal symptoms, and for 
newborns to flush out their systems; and as a decoction 
used as a bath for colds, rheumatism and coughs (Bean 
and Saubel 1972; Bocek 1984; Foster and Hobbs 2002).  
 

that are thought to inhibit germination and growth of 
some plants, resulting in relatively bare patches of soil 
under and around the shrub (Hauser 2006).  This plant is 
moderately adapted to fire, resprouting from the root 
crown about 25% of the time, or germinating from seed, 
especially in the second year after a fire (Keeley 1998).  
Foliage contains substantial amounts of oil, making it 
highly flammable during the summer (Perry 1981).   
 
Establishment 
California sagebrush can be established from container 
stock or by direct seeding.  Shallow seeding methods 
should be used, such as hydroseeding or broadcasting 
followed by seed imprinting, as seeds have a light 
requirement for germination.  For restoration projects, 
especially on steeper slopes, either seeding method can be 
followed by blowing a thin layer of straw at a rate of 
approximately 1,500 lbs/acre (1,689 kg/ha), with a 
hydromulch slurry of water, wood fiber at 300 lbs/acre 
(340 kg/ha), and tackifier (soil stabilizer) at 120 lbs/acre 
(135 kg/ha) sprayed over the straw (Montalvo et al. 
2002). 
 
Management 
For ornamental use, shrubs should be pruned or pinched 
back each year to maintain their form.  In range, livestock 
generally avoid California sagebrush due to the pungent 
aroma and bitter taste, although domestic goats will 
browse the shrub year-round (Hauser 2006).   
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known pests or diseases of concern.  
However, the plant is sensitive to sulphur dioxide and 
ozone air pollution, which reduce foliar cover and may 
result in plant death (Preston 1988; Westman 1985).  
Elevated nitrogen deposition levels in the Los Angeles air 
basin also pose a threat to stand longevity, as exotic 
annual grasses tend to out-compete the shrub under such 
conditions (Hauser 2006). 
 
Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns associated 
with California sagebrush.

Control 
California sagebrush can be controlled with the herbicides 
glyphosate and 2,4-D (Hauser 2006).  Please contact your 
local agricultural extension specialist or county weed 
specialist to learn what works best in your area and how 
to use it safely. Always read label and safety instructions 
for each control method. Trade names and control 
measures appear in this document only to provide specific 
information. USDA, NRCS does not guarantee or 
warranty the products and control methods named, and 
other products may be equally effective.  
 
Seeds and Plant Production 
There are approximately 5,500,000 seeds/lb (12,000,000 
seeds/kg; S & S Seeds 2009).  Seed is collected from 
October to February from mature (brown) inflorescences.  
Seed is light to dark brown when mature, and achenes 
should be pulled from the seed head at time of collection 
to check for maturity (they should not be green) (Young 
2001).   
 
Germination occurs in 21–30 days at 73.4˚F (23˚C) in 
light, and no seed treatment is required. Germination rates 
are generally 60–75% in controlled environments, but as 
low as 10–30% when broadcast (Keeley 1987; Perry 
1981; Young 2001).  Stratification at 41˚F (5˚C) for 15 
days is reported to produce more rapid and uniform 
germination in other species of Artemisia (Long 1986), 
and stratification for three months at 41˚F (5˚C) is used to 
improve germination of California sagebrush in 
commercial nurseries (personal communication, 
California Flora Nursery, 5 November 2009).   
 
Young (2001) recommends surface sowing seed in flats, 
then transplanting seedlings to individual tubes (2” dia. x 
7” deep Deepot 16) 21 days after germination (transplant 
survival rate of 70%), and maintaining seedlings in a 
shadehouse for at least five weeks to develop further 
before being planted out.  Alternately, seed can be sown 
directly in individual containers (1.5” dia. x 8.25” deep 
Supercell), with thinning required one and two months 

after sowing to leave only a single plant per container 
(Long 1986).   
 
Shrubs can also be propagated by semi-hard new-wood 
cuttings in the spring.  Cuttings are treated with rooting 
hormone and maintained in flats with bottom heat and 
mist until rooted (personal communication, California 
Flora Nursery, 5 November 2009).   
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
These plant materials are somewhat available from 
commercial sources: 
  
‘Canyon Gray,’ also called trailing sagebrush, is a 
prostrate cultivar that spreads along the ground, reaching 
3 ft (0.9 m) high and 6 ft (1.8 m) wide.  It prefers sunny 
locations, is drought tolerant, and deer resistant (Yerba 
Buena Nursery 2009). 
 
‘Montara’ was selected by Roger Raiche at Montara 
Ridge in San Mateo County, CA.  This cultivar forms a 
mound of finely-cut, fragrant foliage to around 2-3 ft (0.6-
0.9 m) tall by 3 ft (0.9 m) wide.  The plant requires full 
sun with decent drainage and is drought tolerant once 
established, but occasional summer water helps retain 
fresh look.  Montara thrives in coastal environments and 
is deer resistant (California Flora Nursery 2009).
