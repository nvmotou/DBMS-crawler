these fruits in their food economy (Waterman 1920).  
 
Small cranberries were gathered wild in England and 
Scotland and made into tarts, marmalade, jelly, jam, 
and added to puddings and pies (Eastwood 1856). 
Many colonists were already familiar with this fruit 
in Great Britain before finding it in North America. 
The small cranberry helped stock the larder of 
English and American ships, fed trappers in remote 
regions, and pleased the palates of Meriwether Lewis 
and William Clark in their explorations across the 
United States (Lewis and Clark 1965). The Chinook, 
for example, traded dried cranberries with the 
English vessel Ruby in 1795 and at Thanksgiving in 
1805 Lewis and Clark dined on venison, ducks, 
geese, and small cranberry sauce from fruit brought 
by Chinook women (McDonald 1966; Lewis and 
Clark 1965). Because the small cranberry can grow in 
association with large cranberry (Vaccinium 
macrocarpon) in the Great Lakes region, northeastern 
USA and southeastern Canada (Boniello 1993; Roger 
Latham pers. comm. 2009) it is possible that the 
Pilgrims of Plymouth were introduced to both edible 
species by the Wampanoag. 
 
The berries are still gathered today in the United 
States, Canada, and Europe (Himelrick 2005). The 
Makah, Quinault, and Quileute of the Olympic 
Peninsula still gather them every fall and non-Indians 
from early settler families still gather them (Anderson 
2009). Small cranberries are an important source of 
phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins, that 
show high anti-oxidant potential (Kahkonen et al. 
2001; Kahkonen et al. 1999). They are an excellent 
source of flavonols, having higher concentrations 
than apples (Himelrick 2005). 
 
There were many indigenous ways to prepare and eat 
cranberries. Berries could be eaten fresh, boiled, 
baked in a pit, dried or stored for future use, and in 
later times they were canned and used for making 
jams, jellies, and pies (Gill 1984; Olson 1936). In 
western Washington, the berries were usually stored 
in boxes or baskets until soft and brown (Gunther 
1973). For example, among the Quileute on the 
Olympic Peninsula cranberries either sat in storage 
until they became soft, or they were crushed and 
eaten with grease (Powell and Morganroth 1998). 
The Potawatomi and the Menomini of Wisconsin 
sweetened the berries with maple sugar (Smith 1933; 
Smith 1923). The Menomini dried them in the sun for 
winter use and ate dried cranberries and dried sweet 
corn together, sweetened with maple sugar (Smith 
1923). In the Northeastern United States, pemmican

Uses 
Said to have a superior flavor to the cultivated 
cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) (Shepard 1855; 
Eastwood 1856), large quantities of the tart berries 
were gathered in the fall by tribes of the Great Lakes 
region such as the Menomini and Potawatomi (Smith 
1923; Smith 1933), tribes of the Northeast such as the 
Iroquois and Lenape (Stout 1914; Waugh 1916), the 
Inuit of Alaska (Trehane 2004), the Chinook of 
Oregon, and the Makah, Klallam, Hoh, Quileute, 
Quinault, and Chemakum of western Washington 
(Gunther 1973; Hedrick 1972; Eells 1996; Archibald 
1999). The First Nations of Canada, such as the 
Haida, Kwakwaka'wakw, and other cultural groups 
also relished the berries (Turner 2004; U'mista 
Cultural Society et al. 1998). Because the berries last 
through the winter and preserve well under the snow, 
they could also be gathered in spring as was done by 
the Dena'ina of south-central Alaska and the Woods 
Cree of Canada (Kari 1987; Leighton 1985). Even 
though they are small, the importance of these berries 
to many indigenous cultures should not be 
underestimated. The fact that the month of September 
is connected with "the season for cranberries" in the 
Makah lunar calendar underscores the importance of 

 

was made by pounding cranberries into a mixture of 
dried, smoked game meat, animal fat, and seeds 
(Kavasch 1995). The Canadian Chippewa combined 
dried berries with moose fat or deer tallow (Buttree 
1932).  The Kwakwaka'wakw of western British 
Columbia ate the berries fresh to quench thirst or 
dried them into cakes. Their favorite way to prepare 
them was to boil them and serve them with grease 
(U'mista Cultural Society et al. 1998) from eulachon 
(Thaleichthys pacificus), a small West-coast fish.  
Early non-Indian settlers, having learned of their 
edibility from the Indians, made cranberry sauces, 
bubbling tarts, and nogs from cranberries. The 
Indians of western Washington also used the fruit as 
a paint (Eells 1996).  
 
Wildlife: The berries are eaten by many kinds of 
animals such as Roosevelt elk, black bears, black-
tailed deer, foxes, squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, and 
hares (Anderson 2009; Jacquemart 1997; Matthews 
1992). Birds such as wild geese, Hudsonian godwits, 
sharp-tailed grouse, and ring-necked pheasants also 
eat small cranberries (Matthews 1992; Haskin 1934). 
The small cranberry is a larval food plant for the 
listed Makah copper butterfly in western Washington 
(Pyle and Pyle 2001). Many birds use small cranberry 
ecosystems for foraging and/or nesting including the 
rock ptarmigan, willow ptarmigan, common loon, 
double-crested cormorant, great blue heron, Canada 
goose, killdeer, American wigeon, and many others 
(Jacquemart 1997; Czech and Parsons 2002). 

Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Description 
General:  A member of the heath family (Ericaceae), 
small cranberry is a trailing, vine-like shrub with 
delicate stems that often creep over Sphagnum moss. 
The plant has alternate small evergreen leaves with 
rolled edges that are dark green above, pale beneath, 
and pointed at the tip. The pale rose flowers have 
petals that are bent backwards. The one to four 
flowers appear between May and August and look 
like small shooting stars. They form a terminal 
cluster and spring from the tips of stems (Gleason 
and Cronquist 1991; Pettinger and Costanzo 2002).  
The red, sometimes off-white berry is small (3/8 inch 
wide), round, and slightly acid, ripening between 
August and October (Jacquemart 1997; Clark 1998; 
Piper and Beattie 1915; Pojar and MacKinnon 1994; 
Pettinger and Costanzo 2002). The plant is similar in 
appearance to the cultivated cranberry (Gleason and 
Cronquist 1991). 

 

 

Small cranberry distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 

The small cranberry occurs throughout Alaska and 
across Canada to Labrador, Greenland, and 
Newfoundland, south through the New England 
states, the northern portions of the Great Lake States, 
and western Washington and Oregon. It also occurs 
in northern Europe and Asia (Matthews 1992; 
Gleason and Cronquist 1991). For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  The small cranberry is found in wetlands: 
bogs, swamps, and muskegs and along the marshy 
shores of ponds and lakes. Many of these wetlands 
were created by the melting of glaciers 10,000 to 
18,000 year ago (Jones 1936). This species often 
occurs where there is no perched water table caused 
by a hardpan. The typical habitat of this species is 
Sphagnum peat and sometimes sand or hardpan. This 
vine is occasionally found in tidal wetlands along 
both the western and eastern shores of North America 
(Tiner 2009; Gunther 1973). Since the small 
cranberry is shade intolerant, relic stands occur in 
bogs that have developed a conifer overstory 
(Conway 1949; Matthews 1992). It is found in small 
swamps in pine barrens in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
New York and New England. 

Adaptation 
Small cranberry is one of the first colonizers of 
burned bogs and increases in abundance with 
repeated fires if the fires are not too severe (Flinn and 
Wein 1977; Vogl 1964; Matthews 1992). It also 
regenerates vegetatively by re-growing from 
rhizomes and by layering (Flinn and Wein 1988; 
Matthews 1992).  

Establishment 
Small cranberry can be propagated by seeds or by 
cuttings or by severing sectors of rooted runners 
(Trehane 2004). Cuttings should be taken during the 
dormant season, and treated with rooting hormone 
(Leopold 2005). It needs a sunny location in the 

garden with wet to moist, acidic and often peaty soils 
(Pettinger and Costanzo 2002). 

Management 
Early non-Indian descriptions of the small cranberry 
paint a picture of abundance. Albert Reagan reported 
in 1928 for the Bois Fort Ojibwa of Minnesota that: 
"Cranberries [both Vaccinium macrocarpon and V. 
oxycoccos] are very plentiful in the swampy regions 
and are quite an article of food. Many bushels of 
them are sold by the Indians each year (Reagan 
1928). Part of the coast of Lake Superior was 
described as "flaming red with [Vaccinium 
oxycoccos] berries" in 1855 (Eastwood 1856). James 
Swan recorded in his diary on October 23, 1859 
about the northwest coast of Washington that "Mr. 
Webster shipped on board of the Hartford 23 barrels 
of cranberries [Vaccinium oxycoccos] " (Swan 1859-
1866). These barrels were obtained from the Makah.

Reports of such large quantities suggest the 
possibility of Indian stewardship to increase fruit 
yields. Lightning is rare within the Pacific 
northwestern distribution of small cranberries (Agee 
1993; Kay 2007; Vitt et al. 1990), and tribes 
maintained them by burning (Anderson 2009; 
Latham 2008). The primary role of fire was to keep 
open habitats for the small cranberries and other 
useful plants. Burning arrested the processes of 
succession that would otherwise have allowed the 
forest to advance, which would have reduced sunlight 

 

 

to the fruit-bearing plants, increased competition for 
nutrients, and made the plants more difficult to get to 
and harvest. Gregory Colfax, Makah, explains this 
function of burning in relation to small cranberries: 
“My dad [Lloyd Colfax] mentioned that the [Ts’oo-
yuhs] prairie was burned yearly or whenever it was 
necessary. When the cranberry bogs would get so 
overgrown then the folks knew that it was time to do 
it. And so it was generally in autumn I think when it 
happened—just at the time when you had your long 
spells of light summer weather in September and 
October. And it was the perfect time to do it because 
you match it to the wind and you match it to 
upcoming rains” (pers. comm.).  
 
Indian burning of bogs also had a directly beneficial 
effect on individual cranberry plants, maintaining 
vigor and stimulating the production of berries. 
Without pruning or burning, the vines produce many 
runners, and produce less and less fruit. Traditionally 
tribes in western Washington, such as the Quinault 
and the Makah, burned off bogs periodically not only 
to keep them open by eliminating encroaching shrubs 
and trees but also to stimulate the plants to produce 
more fruit (Anderson 2009). This probably would 
have a similar effect to the pruning of the cultivated 
cranberry practiced by growers today. They prune 
heavily vined cranberries for two reasons: 1) severing 
most of the runners removes apical dominance in 
many of the vines, promoting new uprights to 
produce fruit in the second year after pruning; and 2) 
removing top growth allows more sunlight to reach 
the vines, encouraging increased flower bud initiation 
(Eck 1990). Paul Eck (1990) instructs cranberry 
growers to burn or mow overgrown bogs during the 
dormant season to bring them back into productive 
bearing.   
 
Today conifers and hardwoods are advancing into 
bogs (Rigg 1922; Reichle and Doyle 1965; Tiner 
1991) where the small cranberries grow and this is 
partly due to the cessation of Indian-set fires that kept 
them open (Latham 2008; Anderson 2009) and to the 
later stages of forest regrowth after clearcutting.
