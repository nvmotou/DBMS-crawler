native pollinators (Cane, 2011; Ogle and others, 2011b). 
The seeds are eaten by birds and rodents. It is believed 
that the presence of arrowleaf balsamroot may serve as an 
indicator of good habitat for sage-grouse (Klebenow, 
1969).  
 
Restoration: Because of its showy flowers and dominance 
on the landscape, arrowleaf balsamroot is commonly used 
in restoration seedings. The species is believed to have 
potential for use in oil shale, roadside and mining 
restoration practices (Wasser, 1982). Attempts to seed 
arrowleaf balsamroot outside its natural area of 
occurrence have been largely unsuccessful (Stevens and 
Monsen, 2004).  
 
Medicinal: Arrowleaf balsamroot has been found to 
contain antibacterial compounds (Matsuura and others, 
1996), and has been used as an herbal medicine 
(Chambers and others, 2006).

Description 
General: Sunflower family (Asteraceae). Arrowleaf 
balsamroot is a long-lived perennial forb native to western 
North America. The sagittate (arrowhead shaped)  leaves 
are mostly all basal and petiolate, 5 to 45 cm (2 to 18 in) 
long and 1.5 to 15 cm (0.6 to 6 in) wide. Upper stem 
leaves are smaller and linear to elliptic. The leaves are 
silvery white to green. Several flower stems arise from the 
root crown to a height of 15 to 80 cm (6 to 31 in). The 
stems bear a solitary floral head with yellow ray and disk 
flowers. Eight to twenty-five ray flowers with 20 to 60 
mm (0.8 to 2.4 in) long petals surround a disk that is 12 to 
25 mm in diameter. Both the ray and disk flowers are 
fertile. The fruit is a glabrous achene with no pappus 
(Weber, 1997; Welsh and others, 2003). The taproots can 
be quite large reaching 2.7 m (8.8 ft) long and 10 cm (4 
in) in diameter. Deep lateral roots can run horizontally for 
60 to 100 cm (2 to 3 ft) (Weaver, 1915). 

Ethnobotany 
Many tribes used arrowleaf balsamroot medicinally. The 
Blackfoot used root smoke to treat body aches (Hellson, 
1974). The Blackfoot, Gosiute, Kutenai, Paiute, Sanpoil 
and Shoshoni used a poultice made from the roots to treat 
blisters, sores, insect bites, bruises and wounds (Hellson, 
1974; Chamberlin, 1911; Hart, 1992; Train and others, 
1941; Ray, 1932). Root infusions were used by the 
Cheyenne and Flathead to treat fevers, whooping cough,

Uses 
Wildlife: A wide variety of wildlife utilizes arrowleaf 
balsamroot. Deer, elk, bighorn sheep and pronghorn eat 
the leaves, stems and flowers. Arrowleaf balsamroot can 
be used to improve spring and summer forage in open 
rangelands. Ogle and Brazee (2009) list arrowleaf 
balsamroot as desired forage for cattle, sheep, elk, and 
pronghorn in spring and summer.  Young tissues of 
arrowleaf balsamroot contain nearly 30% protein 
(Rickets, 1994). Arrowleaf balsamroot is attractive to 

 

and tuberculosis. They also used them as a urinary aid and 
cathartic (Grinnell, 1905; Hart, 1992; Ray, 1932). Root 
decoctions were also used by the Cheyenne, Miwok, 
Shoshoni and Paiute for headaches, stomachaches, 
rheumatism, venereal disease, and as an eyewash and 
birthing aid (Barrett and Gifford, 1933; Train and others, 
1941; Grinnell, 1972). The Flathead and Okanagan-
Colleville tribes used poultices of leaves to treat burns 
(Hart, 1992; Turner and others, 1980). 
 
The leaves, stems, roots and seeds of arrowleaf 
balsamroot were commonly eaten by several western 
tribes. The Flathead, Kutenai, Montana, Nez Perce, 
Okanagan-Colville, Paiute, Thompson and Ute tribes ate 
raw or cooked leaves and young stems (Hart, 1992, 
Blankinship, 1905; Turner and others, 1980; Mahar, 1953; 
Steedman, 1928; Teit, 1928).  
 
Arrowleaf balsamroot seeds were a staple for many tribes. 
They were eaten raw, ground into flour for making cakes, 
used for cooking oil, or mixed with other foods by the 
Atsugewi, Gosiute, Klamath, Miwok, Montana, Nez 
Perce, Okanagan-Colville, Paiute and Thompson tribes 
(Garth, 1953; Chamberlin, 1911; Coville, 1897; Barrett 
and Gifford, 1933; Blankinship, 1905; Hart, 1992; Turner 
and others, 1980; Teit, 1928; Murphey, 1990; Mahar, 
1953; Steedman, 1928).  

Distribution:  Arrowleaf balsamroot occurs throughout 
western North America from Alberta and British 
Columbia, east to the Dakotas and south to Colorado and 
Arizona. For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 

Habitat:  Arrowleaf balsamroot grows on open hillsides 
and prairies at mid to upper elevations in the 
Intermountain West and Rocky Mountain regions. It is 
commonly associated with sagebrush communities 
including basin big sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, 
threetip sagebrush and infrequently with Wyoming big 
sagebrush. Arrowleaf balsamroot can also be found 
growing in mountain shrub, pinyon-juniper, ponderosa 
pine, Douglas fir and aspen plant communities (Welsh 
and others, 2003). 

Adaptation 
Arrowleaf balsamroot is adapted to fine to medium 
textured soils in areas typically receiving 30 to 65cm (12 
to 25 in) of annual precipitation. However populations are 
known in Wyoming big sagebrush sites receiving about 
23 cm (9 in) of annual precipitation. Because of the deep 
taproot, arrowleaf balsamroot tolerates fire, grazing, 
trampling and drought (Stevens and Monsen, 2004). It 
prefers well-drained silty to loamy soils with a pH range 
of 6.5 to 8.0 (Stevens and Monsen, 2004; USDA NRCS 
2011). The plants are often found in open, full sun, but 
can also tolerate partial shade. It occurs naturally from 
300 to 2,700 m (1,000 to 9,000 ft) in elevation. 
 

 

 

Establishment 
Arrowleaf balsamroot should be drilled seeded into a 
weed free seed bed in late fall. Seeding depth should be 
set to 0.6 to 1.3 cm (0.25 to 0.5 in). Broadcast seeding can 
be successful if the seed is subsequently covered. The full 
stand seeding rate, based on 25 pure live seeds (PLS) per 
foot at 30 cm (12 in) spacing, is 21 kg/ha (19 lb/ac). 
When planted in a mixture, the seeding rate should be 
adjusted according to the proportion of arrowleaf 
balsamroot in the mix. Young seedlings develop slowly 
and are not competitive against more vigorous species. 
Alternate row seeding is recommended (Stevens and 
Monsen, 2004). Dense stands may take 10 years or more 
to develop. 

Management 
Arrowleaf balsamroot should be used as a minor 
component of seed mixtures.  Management strategies 
should be based on the key species in the established plant 
community.  Grazing should be deferred on seeded lands 
for at least two growing seasons to allow for full stand 
establishment (Ogle and others, 2011a; Stevens and 
Monsen, 2004). Blaisdell and Mueggler (1956) found that 
2,4-D applications sprayed on sagebrush rangelands 
resulted in heavy damage to arrowleaf balsamroot. 
 
Arrowleaf balsamroot is tolerant of fire due to its deep 
taproot. Following fires, the plants will often regenerate 
from the persisting caudex (Smith and Fisher 1997). 

Pests and Potential Problems 
Rodents and birds feed on the seed (Skinner, 2004), and 
can be problematic in seed production fields. Insect 
damage to seed can be significant, and stored seed may 
require pesticide treatment and cold storage (Skinner, 
2004; Stevens and Monsen, 2004). Mold has been 
observed on seedlings in greenhouse and growth chamber 
production (Chambers and others, 2006). 

Environmental Concerns 
Arrowleaf balsamroot is native to western North America. 
It will spread under favorable conditions but does not 
pose any environmental concern to native plant 
communities. 
 
Seed and Plant Production 
Plant Production: Seed of arrowleaf balsamroot requires 
stratification for germination (Chambers and others, 2006; 
Young and Evans, 1979). Seed should be sown into 
containers to a depth of 0.6 to 1.3 cm (0.25 to 0.5 in) and 
lightly covered with pea gravel and then placed outdoors 
in late fall or early winter for natural stratification. This 
species requires low temperatures, 0 to 10° C, (32 to 50° 
F) for germination (Baskin and others 2002; Chambers 
and others, 2006; Young and Evans, 1979). Germination 
begins in March and continues for 3 or more weeks 
(Skinner, 2004). Chambers and others (2006) showed 
increased germination with ethylene treatment. Seeds 
sown in media soaked in an ethylene solution of 10 ml to 

14.4 l water averaged 28% germination, while the non-
treated control treatment averaged 2.5% germination. 
Transplanting is difficult. Plants should be handled with 
care to prevent damage to the root system (Chambers and 
others, 2006; Skinner, 2004). The plants develop slowly 
and take 3 or more years after establishment to produce 
flowers. 
 
Seed Production: Seed production fields are typically 
planted at 91 to 107 cm (36 to 42 in) row spacing to 
facilitate between-row cultivation. Seed should be planted 
at a depth of 0.6 to 1.3 cm (0.25 to 0.5 in) at 60 PLS/m 
(20 PLS/ft) of row. Seed is sown in the fall to allow for 
natural over winter stratification. Germination is reported 
to be erratic with new plants appearing for 2 to 3 years 
after planting (Stevens and others, 1996).  
 
Once established arrowleaf balsamroot is very 
competitive against weeds. When necessary, weeds are 
controlled by hand or with between- row cultivation. Pre-
emergence and spot treatments of herbicides can also be 
used once the plants are well established (Stevens and 
others, 1996). 
 
Fertilizer is generally not recommended. Fields are 
irrigated to a cumulative total of 38 to 51 cm (15 to 20 in) 
per year including natural precipitation. The soils should 
not be over saturated. Overhead irrigation should be 
avoided during pollination.

NRCS PLANTS Database  
 
Plants are slow to develop and may take 3 to 5 years to 
reach full production (Stevens and others, 1996); 
however, once established seed fields will produce for 20 
to 30 years. Arrowleaf balsamroot requires insect 
visitation for seed production. Cane (2005) found that no 
seed was set in monitored plants without bee visitation, 
and significantly more seed was set with outcrossing. He 
further calculated that at least 165 nesting females of 
Osmia californica are needed to pollinate a one-hectare 
(67 bees/ac) seed production field of arrowleaf 
balsamroot.  
 

 

 

Seed crops are often damaged by frost.  Seed in wildland 
stands is often lost due to insect and wildlife use.  
 
Harvest can be done by hand, with a vacuum-type 
harvester or by direct combining. Timing of seed harvest 
is critical. Mature viable seed shatters readily, leaving 
only immature and insect-damaged seed. This low-quality 
seed often appears to be normal and healthy and is often 
mistakenly harvested and sold (Stevens and Monsen, 
2004).  
 
Seed cleaning is easy with the seed falling readily from 
the flower heads. The heads can also be rubbed, lightly 
milled or brushed to remove maximum seed. Seed can be 
cleaned with screen cleaners and indent cleaners. Insect 
damaged seed is lighter than viable seed and can be 
separated with gravity or air (Stevens and Monsen, 2004). 
Well cleaned seed should have purities of 95% or greater 
with approximately 40% viability (Barner, 2009; Stevens 
and Monsen, 2004). Peak yields of 84 to 140 kg/ha (75 to 
125 lbs/ac) have been reported (Stevens and others 1996).  
There are approximately 128,000 seeds/kg (58k seeds/lb) 
(USDA NRCS 2011) at 100% purity. . 
 
Seed should be stored at cold temperatures (1 to 4° C [33 
to 40° F]) (Barner, 2009; Skinner, 2004). Seed is 
susceptible to insect damage and can be treated with 
pesticide prior to storage (Plummer and others, 1968; 
Stevens and others, 1996).  

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Wildland collected seed is available from commercial 
sources. There are currently no commercial releases of 
arrowleaf balsamroot.
