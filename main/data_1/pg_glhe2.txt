Uses 
Ethnobotanical:  Ground ivy was used as a flavoring and 
clearing agent in brewing beer before it was replaced by 
hops (Mitich, 1994).  Germans began using hops in the 8th 
century, but hops were not introduced to England until 
the14th century (Hatfield, 1971).  Many people believed 
hops were dangerous to their health until the 17th century 
(Hatfield, 1971).  One of ground ivy’s common names, 
alehoffs, means “ale ivy”.  It is derived from the old 
English brewing term, hofe (Durant, 1976).  Another of 
ground ivy’s common names contains the word gill, 
which is from the French word guiller, meaning “to 
ferment ale” (Hatfield 1971). 
 
Ground ivy was also used for treating innumerable 
medical conditions.  Graeco-Roman mythology claimed it 
cured melancholy (Hatfield, 1971).  European herbalists 
used it to treat disorders of the bladder, kidneys, digestive 
tract and skin; gout, coughs, colds, and ringing in the ears 
(Gerard, 1964).  They also used it to cure eye disorders in 
livestock (Gerard, 1964).  Early English settlers brought 
ground ivy to the New World as part of their standard 
stock of household herbs (Hatfield, 1971).  During the 
19th century in the U.S., ground ivy was used for treating 
lung and kidney diseases, asthma, jaundice, 
hypochondria,  “monomania” (a condition of “partial 
insanity”), and it was snuffed to treat persistent headache 
(Lestrange, 1971 as cited by Mitich, 1994).  Ground ivy 
was also given to painters to treat “lead-colic” (Durant, 
1976).  The plant is still used in herbal medicine in 
modern times, for its astringent, diuretic and stimulant 
properties (Hatfield, 1971; Waggy, 2009). 
 
Old English recipes recommended adding ground ivy to 
jams, soups, oatmeal and vegetable dishes (LeStrange, 
1977, as cited by Mitich, 1994).  Wreathes were once 
made with the trailing stems of ground ivy and placed on 
the dead, and the Swiss believed when worn with rue, 
agrimony, maiden-hair and broom straw, it could improve 
vision and indicate the presence of witches (Blatchley, 
1930).  Ground ivy is high in iron and is a valuable 
addition to compost (Hatfield, 1971). 
 
Ornamental:  Ground ivy is sold by garden nurseries for a 
ground cover and hanging baskets.  The variegated 
cultivar ‘Variegata’ is tremendously popular.  In Europe, 
the variegated cultivar has been found growing in natural 
habitats (Hutchings and Price, 1999). 
 
Wildlife:  Many species of invertebrates and a few species 
of mammals utilize ground ivy for forage in Europe 
(Watts, 1968; Hutchings and Price, 1999).  In the U.S., it

is a potential food source for introduced boars in the 
Smokey Mountains (Bratton, 1974). 
 
Livestock:  Ground ivy is toxic to horses if they 
consume a large amount of fresh material or hay 
(Kingsbury, 1964; Vanselow and Brendieck-Worm, 
2012).  Vanselow and Bredick-Worm (2012) concluded 
from a literature review horses may experience toxicosis 
if they consume alfalfa hay containing 30% or more 
ground ivy or if they feed exclusively on ground ivy.  The 
toxicity may be caused by the volatile oils common in 
many Lamiaceae species (Kingsbury, 1964).  Symptoms 
of toxicity include sweating, salivation, labored breathing, 
pupil dilation and occasionally signs of pulmonary edema 
(Kingsbury, 1964).  No other forms of livestock are 
known to be affected.  Livestock in general tend to avoid 
ground ivy because of its bitter taste.   

Status 
Glechoma hederacea is native to Europe and Asia, and 
was brought to the U.S. by early European colonists 
(Mack, 2003).  It is listed as a noxious species in 
Connecticut (USDA NRCS, 2013).  In most states, it is 
listed as a facultative upland species.  It usually occurs in 
non-wetland habitats but has 1 to 33% probability of 
occurring in a wetland (USDA NRCS, 2013).   

Weediness 
Ground ivy may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats (USDA NRCS, 2013).  Plants are 
clonal and form dense mats.  They rapidly colonize a 
disturbed site by producing stolons and ramets 
(overwintering stolon fragments).  The plants can 
morphologically adapt to changes in environmental 
conditions such as nutrient and light availability (Slade 
and Hutchings, 1987).  They produce more vertical and 
horizontal growth in the presence of other plants to avoid 
competition (Hutchings and Price, 1999).   
 
Plants reproduce primarily by vegetative means, with 
rosettes and ramets (Waggy, 2009).  They also reproduce 
by seed.  Four seeds are produced per flower, and the 
seeds are dispersed by gravity and animal transport 
(Bouman and Meeuse, 1992).  The viability of seed may 
vary from less than one year to multiple years, depending 
on environmental conditions (Waggy, 2009). 
 
There is little information regarding the impact of ground 
ivy on native plant communities, which may suggest it is 
less of a threat than other invasive species (Waggy, 2009).  
The turf grass industry, however, considers ground ivy a 
significant threat to lawns.  It disrupts turf uniformity and 
is very difficult to eradicate (Hatterman-Valenti et al., 
1996; Spangenberg, 2001; Kohler et al., 2004).

Description 
General:  Mint family (Lamiaceae).  Glechoma hederacea 
is perennial forb introduced from Europe.  It is clonal and 
forms carpet-like mats, with long, slender, square stolons 
that produce fibrous roots at the nodes.  Rosette buds also 
form at the stolon nodes, which develop into secondary 
stolons and ramets (overwintering stolon fragments).  
Plant growth is primarily horizontal, except during 
flowering, when stolon tips grow upwards.  Upright stems 
can reach a height of 4 to 16 inches tall.  After flowering, 
the stems arch down and resume horizontal growth.  The 
vertical stems are thicker than the stolons, are smooth or 
covered with short, stiff hairs, and have long, soft, straight 
hairs at the nodes.  Leaves are opposite, have petioles, and 
are 0.4 to 1.2 inches long.  Leaves are smooth or have 
stiff hairs, are heart- or kidney-shaped and have rounded 
teeth.  Flowers occur in verticils that originate in the leaf 
axils.  They have short pedicels and calyxes with 15 
nerves and long upper teeth.  Flowers bloom early to mid 
or late season, depending on geographic region, and are 
blue-violet with purple spots.  They have a tubular shape, 
0.5 to 0.9 inch long, with unequal lobes.  The central lobe 
is spreading and much larger than the lateral and upper 
lobes.  Flowers have 4 stamens, with the upper pair 
longer, and the style is slender, divided into two parts.  
The ovaries are two-celled and superior.  The fruit has 

four nutlets, each containing one seed.  Plants reproduce 
sexually by seed, and vegetatively by rosettes and ramets.  
In warmer climates, the plants may be evergreen.  
(Hitchcock and Cronquist, 1973; Slade and Hutchings, 
1987; Hutchings and Price, 1999; Waggy, 2009; Burke 
Museum of Natural History and Cutlure, 2013).     

The genus name Glechoma is from an old Greek name for 
mint or thyme, glechon; and the species name hederacea 
means “of or pertaining to ivy” in Latin (Charters, 2013). 

Distribution:  The first report of ground ivy in North 
America was in 1672 in New England (Wells and Brown, 
2000 as cited by Waggy, 2009).  It is now found in all of 
the United States except New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada 
and Hawaii, and all Canadian provinces (USDA NRCS, 
2013).  It has not spread to the Canadian territories 
Nunavut, Northwest Territories and the Yukon.  For 
current distribution, consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. 

Habitat:  Glechoma hederacea grows in riparian areas, 
deciduous forests, thickets, wetlands and prairies (Waggy, 
2009; Voss and Reznicek, 2012).  It is often found in 
disturbed areas such as roadsides, fallow fields, and 
pasture edges (Bryson and DeFelice, 2010; Voss and 
Reznicek, 2012).  It also invades lawns and gardens.

Adaptation 
This plant will grow in many soil types, including 
riparian, floodplain and wetland soils that are moist but 
not saturated, and in heavily compacted soils (Waggy, 
2009).  In Europe, it grows at elevations from sea level to 
5,200 feet (Hutchings and Price, 1999).  In the U.S., it has 
been documented at elevations of 1,900 to 6,000 feet 
(Waggy, 2009).  The plant primarily grows in shaded 
environments but will also grow in full sunlight, 
particularly where the ground has been disturbed (Bryson 
and DeFelice, 2010). 

 

 

 
Pests and Potential Problems 
None known in North America. 

Environmental Concerns 
Ground ivy may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats (USDA NRCS, 2013).  It is toxic to 
horses when consumed in large quantities (Kingsbury, 
1964). 
 
Control 
Ground ivy is difficult to control with mechanical 
methods because the plant produces rooting stolon 
fragments (Kohler et al., 2004).  Physical control, by 
hand-pulling or raking the plants, is possible only if all 
stolon fragments are removed.  Ground ivy is also 
difficult to control with chemical methods because plants 
will reestablish soon after post-emergence treatment 
(Spangenberg, 2001; Kohler et al., 2004).   
 
To control ground ivy in lawns, Spangenberg (2001) 
recommends a three-way broadleaf herbicide mixture of 
2,4-D, mecoprop (MCPP) and dicamba.  Mixtures with 
clopyralid, dichlorprop, triclopyr, and MCPA may also be 
effective. The herbicide mixture should be applied mid-
spring to early summer and mid-to late fall, when the 
plant is in bloom or at the time of the first frost, and the 
plants should not be mown a few days before and after 
herbicide application (Spangenberg, 2001). 
 
Kohler et al. (2004) compared the effectiveness of 
triclopyr, clopyralid, MCPP, 2,4-D amine, 2,4-D ester, 
dicamba, quinclorac, and fluroxypyr alone or in mixtures, 
applied at different times and rates to control ground ivy.  
They found mixtures containing 2,4-D amine, 2,4-D ester, 
fluroxypyr, or triclopyr applied in the fall at the highest 
labeled rates were the most effective.  They also tested 
various pre-emergent herbicides, and found isoxaben 
prevented the growth and development of ground ivy 
stolons.  Other pre-emergent herbicides: prodiamine, 
pendimethalin and dithiopyr had no effect. 
 
A combination of cultural and chemical methods is 
needed to eradicate ground ivy from lawns (Spangenberg, 
2001; Kohler et al., 2004).  Cultural methods for 
prohibiting the spread of ground ivy include 
(Spangenberg 2001): 

• 

planting shade-tolerant grass, such as fine-leaf 
fescues (Festuca spp.), rough bluegrass (Poa 
trivalis), and supine bluegrass (Poa supina) 

• 

• 

•  minimizing stress, since grasses grown in shade 

do not recover well 
improving light conditions and air circulation by 
trimming trees and shrubs 
improving soil conditions by aerating the soil to 
reduce compaction and improve drainage 
•  mowing at 3” height to increase grass leaf 

surface area 

•  watering infrequently, but deeply when you do 

water 
fertilizing less (44 to 87 lb nitrogen per acre per 
year) 
 

• 

Kohler et al. (2004) found a higher rate of nitrogen was 
needed to reduce ground ivy cover, but they conducted 
experiments on Kentucky bluegrass.  They found 174 lb 
nitrogen per acre per year reduced ground ivy cover by 
24%.   
 
Kolher et al. (2004) recommends a strategy of applying at 
least 174 lb nitrogen per acre per year, applying the pre-
emergent herbicide isoxaben with or after a post-
emergence herbicide, and a fall post-emergence herbicide 
application containing 2,4-D, fluroxypyr or triclopyr at 
the highest labeled rate to control ground ivy in lawns. 
 
Contact your local agricultural extension specialist or 
county weed specialist to learn what herbicides work best 
in your area and how to use them safely.  Always read 
label and safety instructions for each control method.
