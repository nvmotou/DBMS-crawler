Description 
General:  Black oat is an upright, winter annual member 
of the Poaceae family.  Heights vary from 2 ½–5 feet tall 
depending on the growing conditions.  Leaf blades are 
flat, rough and numerous.  The panicle is open, loose and 
oval shaped.  The primary panicle branches droop with 
pendulous spikelets.  Spikelets usually have two fertile 
florets with multiple awns.  The primary awn is straight, 
black and 0.7–1.4 inches long.  Black oat sexually 
reproduces a hairy caryopsis.  In Alabama, black oat seed 
ripens in mid-May through early June (USDA-ARS-
NSDL, 2005; Clayton et al., 2014). 

Plant Guide 

Distribution:  Black oat has a Mediterranean origin and 
has been used in European countries since the Bronze 
Age for cereal or fodder (Diedrichsen, 2014; Kubiak, 
2009).  Its use in Europe declined dramatically with the 
introduction of the more productive common oat (Avena 
sativa).  Currently, black oat is grown in Brazil, the 
temperate areas of Argentina and Uruguay, the temperate 
area of Chile, and the tropical high altitude areas in 
Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru as a winter season cover crop 
(FAO, 2004).  It is also grown on marginal soils in the 
Outer Hebrides of Scotland and Australia (Scholten et al., 
2009; Kubiak, 2009).  Black oat is used in the 
southeastern United States, Hawaii, and Arizona for 
forage, pasture and as a cover crop.  For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS website. 

Adaptation 
Black oat does best on sandy or loamy soils but can also 
grow in heavy clay and soils with low nutrient value.  It is 
not highly shade tolerant but can tolerate drought (Plants 
for A Future, 2012).  Black oat is not cold hardy and will 
winter kill at temperatures less than 19°F depending on 
growth stage (Ashford and Reeves, 2003).  In the United 
States, the black oat cultivar ‘SoilSaver’ is adapted for use 
as a winter cover crop in USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 
8b-10a (USDA-ARS-NSDL, 2005). 

Uses 
Cover Crop/Green manure:  Black oat is used as a cool 
season, annual, rotational cover crop either alone or 
seeded into a cover crop mixture.  It is not frost tolerant.  
Black oat produces dry matter amounts similar to other 
winter cereals such as rye and wheat of 4,000–7000 
pounds per acre when planted alone (USDA-ARS-NSDL, 
2010).  However, in experiments in Alabama, black oat 
grew quicker than wheat and rye (Patterson et al., 1996).  
Additionally, researchers have found that black oat has a 
higher nitrogen concentration and lower C:N ratio than 
four other winter cereals commonly used as cover crops 
(Bauer and Reeves, 1999).   
 
Weed Management:  Similar to many other cover crop 
species, black oat leaf tissue has been found to have 
allelopathic effects that can inhibit small seeded weed 
species (Price et al., 2008).  In greenhouse and field 
experiments conducted in Germany, black oat reduced the 
shoot dry matter of weeds and volunteer wheat by up to 
98% (Brust and Gerhards, 2012).  In a study conducted 
without herbicide in Alabama, black oat provided more 
effective weed control in conservation tillage cotton than 
rye in years it was not winter killed (Reeves et al., 2005). 
 

 

Pest Management:  Black oat has been shown to have a 
high resistance to barley yellow dwarf virus (Comeau, 
1984), and most studies indicate that black oat is resistant 
to, or inhibits, some species of nematodes.  In a 
greenhouse study of 52 plant species suitable for cover 
crops, a Brazilian black oat cultivar was shown to be 
resistant to root-knot nematode (Lima et al., 2009).  In a 
study in Connecticut, fewer lesion nematodes were found 
in the roots of strawberry plants grown in a plot 
previously planted to ‘Saia’ black oat, than plots planted 
to sorghum-sudangrass  (Sorghum bicolor x S. Sudanese) 
or common oats (Avena sativa) (LaMondia et al., 2002).  
Another black oat cultivar, ‘Pratex’, was selected for its 
ability to suppress or control nematodes (Diedrichsen, 
2014).  However, a study in Israel found one black oat 
cultivar, ‘Saia’, infested with root knot nematode (Oka et 
al., 2003). 
 
Forage:  Black oat is considered an excellent feed for 
cattle due to its high nutritional value and good 
digestibility (Restelatto et al., 2013).  Nitrogen application 
has been found to have a large effect on the crude protein 
content of black oat forage.  In a Brazilian study, the 
crude protein content of black oat ranged from 180–249 
grams crude protein per kilogram of dry matter 
(Restelatto et al., 2013).  Black oat has also been studied 
as forage for dairy cows in North Vietnam.  In the study, 
the traditional diets of cows were compared to diets 
supplemented with black oat forage.  Cows fed with the 
black oat diet had a higher milk persistency and milk 
yield than cows receiving the traditional diets (Salgado et 
al., 2013). 
 
Phytoextraction:  In Japan, black oat is being studied for 
its use in phytoextraction of cadmium on agricultural 
soils.  These laboratory studies have found that black oat 
possesses greater potential for cadmium accumulation and 
tolerance than other common crops (Uraguchi et al., 
2006). 
 
Other uses:  Oils extracted from black oat seed are used 
in cosmetics as skin and hair moisturizers (CosIng, 2014).  
Black oat grains can be used for cooking and can also be 
roasted and used as a coffee substitute (Plants for a 
Future, 2012). 

Ethnobotany 
Historically, black oat is believed to have been the 
primary oat crop grown in Europe, particularly on poor or 
marginal soils (Kuszewska and Korniak, 2009).  As the 
more productive common oat became more frequently 
used, black oat came to be regarded as a tolerated weed of 
common oat crops.  With improved seed cleaning 
techniques, European black oat populations have dropped 
with some local cultivars reaching extinction 
(Diedrichsen, 2014).  Small populations of black oat 
survive in areas where common oats do not produce seed 
without significant inputs (Podyma et al., 2002; Scholten, 
2009).  Efforts to revive black oat cultivation in Europe 

are ongoing in order to maintain the gene bank of oat 
species (Diedrichsen, 2014; Podyma et al., 2002; 
Scholten, 2009). 

Status 
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use. 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
(http://plants.usda.gov/) and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values). 

Planting Guidelines 
Black oat can be established in conventional, reduced 
tillage, or no-till cropping systems with drill seeding or 
broadcasting.  Recommended planting dates within a 
region are similar to common oat (USDA-ARS-NSDL, 
2005).  The recommended seeding depth for black oat is 
also similar to common oat, 1–1 ½ inches (McGregor, 
2014). 
 
If planting black oat for cover crop, pest management, 
and/or weed control, some general recommendations are 
to broadcast seed at 100 lbs. per acre or drill seed at 50–
70 lbs. per acre (Malin, 2014; USDA-ARS-NSDL, 2010).  
Lower seeding rates are typically used if planting black 
oat for other purposes or with other species.  For the best 
seeding rates, methods, and practices for your area contact 
your local NRCS office or Extension service. 

Management 
Fertilization:  Fertilizer application frequency and 
amounts will vary with the goals of the planting.  Soils 
should be tested prior to planting to determine fertilizer 
requirements.  Black oat biomass will increase with the 
amount of nitrogen applied.  Applications of 60–80 lbs. of 
nitrogen/acre are common in seed production fields 
(Malin, 2014). 
 
Forage/grazing management:  In Australia, an 
experiment varying the height and frequency of 
defoliation on the dry matter yield of black oat found that 
defoliation every six weeks at a cutting height of 2 inches 
resulted in the highest dry matter yield but the plants had 
less tillers (Lowe and Bowdler, 1988). 
 
Cover crop termination:  Black oat can be killed with 
herbicide, tillage, mowers, and/or a roller crimper.  The 
most effective termination method is largely determined 
by the developmental stage of the black oat at the 
termination date.  In a study conducted in Alabama, the 
most effective and economical method found to kill black 
oat at anthesis was the combination of a roller crimper 
and herbicide (Ashford and Reeves, 2003).  When 

 

termination occurs at the early milk stage or later, the use 
of herbicides may be eliminated.  In greenhouse and field 
trials conducted in Canada, termination of black oats at 
flowering rather than at maturity lowered the percentage 
incidence of leaf spot in residues (Fernandez and Santos, 
1992). 

Pests and Potential Problems 
Depending on the cultivar studied, black oat is reported to 
be moderately susceptible or moderately resistant to 
crown and stem rusts (FAO, 2004; USDA-ARS-NSDL, 
2005).  Seed yield reductions are seen in black oat with 
leaf rust, stem rust and leaf spot but do not affect forage 
production and soil coverage (USDA-ARS-NSDL, 2005).  
Grain can also be affected by fusarium head blight and 
ergot (FAO, 2004).  Black oat seed producers in Oregon 
have reported treating stands for control of the cereal leaf 
beetle (McGregor, 2014).  Please contact your local 
agricultural extension specialist for assistance in proper 
identification of diseases and/or insect pests in your 
fields. 

Environmental Concerns 
Black oat is considered a weed or a contaminant in 
common oat crops or production fields in many countries.  
When used as a green manure/cover crop in a corn seed 
production rotation in Hawaii, producers do not let the 
black oat produce seed to prevent a weed issue in the 
subsequent corn seed crop (Malin, 2014). 
 
Please consult with your local NRCS Field Office, 
Cooperative Extension Service office, state natural 
resource, or state agriculture department regarding its 
status and use.  Weed information is also available from 
the PLANTS Web site at http://plants.usda.gov/. 

Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective. 

Seeds and Plant Production 
When planting for seed production, a firm weed free 
seedbed is needed.  Seeds should be planted 1–1 ½ inches 
deep depending on soil textures.  The recommended 
seeding rate is approximately 20 pure live seeds (PLS) per 
square foot or 40 PLS lbs/acre.  Expected seed yields 
range from 800 to 1400 lbs/acre (USDA-ARS-NSDL, 
2005). 
 
Fertilizer applications should be based upon soil tests.  
The nutrient requirements of black oat seed production 
are similar to that of common oat with applications of 60-
80 lbs. of nitrogen per acre (McGregor, 2014).  Chemical 
control of insects and diseases should follow 

recommendations for common oat (USDA-ARS-NSDL, 
2005). 
 
Black oat seed is harvested by direct combine if standing.  
If the crop is lodged, it is first swathed, allowed to dry, 
and then combined (McGregor, 2014).  Seed is cleaned 
with a standard screen cleaner and an indent cylinder 
separator (McGregor, 2014). 

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
The only cultivar of black oat currently available in the 
US is ‘SoilSaver’.  ‘SoilSaver’ is a joint release between 
Auburn University and the Institute of Agronomy of 
Paraná, Brazil (IAPAR).  It was selected for increased 
cold tolerance by Auburn University and USDA-ARS 
researchers from a population of ‘IAPAR-61-Ibiporã’, a 
public variety released by IAPAR and the Parananese 
Commission for Evaluation of Forages.  Pratex black oat 
is a release developed in northern Germany.  It was 
selected for its ability to suppress or control root lesion 
nematodes and stubby root knot nematodes.  Other 
common cultivars of black oat include ‘Saia’, ‘IAPAR-
61-Ibiporã’ and ‘São Carlos’. 
 
Cultivars should be selected based on the local climate, 
resistance to local pests, and intended use.  Consult with 
your local land grant university, local extension or local 
USDA NRCS office for recommendations on adapted 
cultivars for use in your area.
