and are primarily blended with grains to fortify the 
protein content of livestock feed.  Dried peas are also sold 
for human consumption as whole, split or ground peas.  
Peas are a nutritious legume, containing 15 to 35% 
protein, and high concentrations of the essential amino 
acids lysine and tryptophan (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).   
 
Forage crop:  Peas are grown alone or with cereals for 
silage and green fodder (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  
Peas can also be grazed while in the field.  Young 
Austrian winter pea plants will regrow after being grazed 
multiple times (Clark, 2007). 
 
Rotational crop:  Peas and other legumes are desirable in 
crop rotations because they break up disease and pest 
cycles, provide nitrogen, improve soil microbe diversity 
and activity, improve soil aggregation, conserve soil 
water, and provide economic diversity (Veseth, 1989; 
Lupwayi et al., 1998; Biederbeck et al., 2005; Chen et al., 
2006).   
 
Green manure and cover crop: Peas are grown as green 
manures and cover crops because they grow quickly and 
contribute nitrogen to the soil (Ingels et al., 1994; Clark, 
2007).  Pea roots have nodules, formed by the bacteria 
Rhizobium leguminosarum, which convert atmospheric 
nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3).  Peas also produce an 
abundance of succulent vines that breakdown quickly and 
provide nitrogen (Sarrantonio, 1994, as cited by Clark, 
2007).  Austrian winter peas are the most common type of 
pea used as a green manure or cover crop because they 
are adapted to cold temperatures and fit in many rotations. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 

Description 
General:  Legume family (Fabaceae).  The pea is a cool-
season annual vine that is smooth and has a bluish-green 
waxy appearance.  Vines can be up to 9 ft long, however 
modern cultivars have shorter vines, about 2 ft long.  The 
stem is hollow, and the taller cultivars cannot climb 
without support (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  Leaves are 
alternate, pinnately compound, and consist of two large 
leaflike stipules, one to several pairs of oval leaflets, and 
terminal tendrils (McGee, 2012).  Many modern cultivars 
have a semi-leafless or ‘afila’ leaf type in which the 
leaflets are converted into additional tendrils (McGee, 
2012).

Uses 
Commercial crop: Peas are a cool-season crop grown for 
their edible seed or seed pods.  Different types of peas are 
grown for various purposes.  Garden or green peas are 
harvested before the seed is mature for the fresh or fresh-
pack market (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  Sugar snap 
peas and snow peas lack the inner pod fiber and are also 
harvested early for the fresh or fresh-pack market 
(McGee, 2012).  Field peas, including fall-sown Austrian 
winter peas, are harvested when seeds are mature and dry, 

 

Inflorescences occur in the leaf axils, and consist of 
racemes with one to four flowers. Flowers have five green 
fused sepals and five white, purple or pink petals of 
different sizes.  The top petal is called the ‘standard’, the 
two small petals in the middle are fused together and 
called the ‘keel’ (because of their boat-like appearance), 
and the bottom two petals taper toward the base and are 
called the ‘wings’ (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  Within 
the keel there are ten stamens; nine form a tube that 
surrounds the pistil, and there is one loose stamen.  The 
ovary contains up to 15 ovules, and the fruit is a closed 
pod, 1 to 4 inches long that often has a rough inner 
membrane.  Ripe seeds are round, smooth or wrinkled, 
and can be green, yellow, beige, brown, red-orange, blue-
red, dark violet to almost black, or spotted.   
 
The flowers are primarily self-pollinating, which enables 
breeders to create true breeding lines (Gill and Vear, 
1980).  The plant is a diploid (2n = 14) (Hancock, 2004).

The centers of origin of Pisum sativum are Ethiopia, the 
Mediterranean, and central Asia, with a secondary center 
of diversity in the Near East (Vavilov, 1949).  Humans 
have likely been eating peas for approximately 9,500 
years, and cultivating them for 8,500 years (Elzebroek 
and Wind, 2008).  Greek and Roman writers mentioned 
peas, but varieties were not described until the sixteenth 
century (Simmonds, 1976).   

Distribution:  Pisum sativum is currently grown in 
temperate regions, at high elevations, or during cool 
seasons in warm regions throughout the world (Elzebroek 
and Wind, 2008). Major pea producers are China, India, 
Canada, Russia, France and the United States (Food and 
Agriculture Organization, 2012).  In the United States, the 
most production occurs in Washington, Montana, and 
North Dakota (USDA-National Agricultural Statistics 
Service, 2011).  For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site. 

Adaptation 
Peas are adapted to many soil types, but grow best on 
fertile, light-textured, well-drained soils (Hartmann et al., 

1988; Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  Peas are sensitive to 
soil salinity and extreme acidity.  The ideal soil pH range 
for pea production is 5.5 to 7.0 (Hartmann et al., 1988).  
Peas grow well with 16 to 39 inches annual precipitation 
(Elzebroek and Wind, 2008). 
 
Uncovered pea plants may tolerate temperatures as low as 
14°F, and if covered with snow, may tolerate 
temperatures as low as -22°F (Elzebroek and Wind, 
2008).  Bourion et al. (2003) discovered the freezing 
tolerance in winter and spring pea genotypes is related to 
the concentration of soluble sugars in the leaves.  Peas are 
more tolerant of cold if they are a winter-hardy cultivar 
such as ‘Melrose’, ‘Granger’ or ‘Commonwinter’, planted 
early to ensure adequate growth before the soil freezes, 
and planted into a rough seedbed or grain stubble where 
they have a protected environment (Clark, 2007). 
 
Peas are most productive at temperatures of 55 to 64°F 
(Hartmann et al., 1988).  High temperatures during 
flowering may reduce seed set (Elzebroek and Wind, 
2008), and high temperatures during seed development 
may cause an increased starch and fiber content, lowering 
pea quality (Hartmann et al., 1988). 

Establishment 
Peas are established by seed in the spring or fall.  Seed 
should be inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum 
prior to planting in fields where peas have not been 
previously grown to ensure root nodule formation and the 
fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. Seeding rates vary with 
cultivar, soil type, seed size, climate, disease pressure and 
seeding method.  Typical seeding rates range from 50 to 
80 lb/acre when drilled and 90 to 100 lb/acre when 
broadcast (Clark, 2007).   
 
Seed is planted at a depth of 1.5 to 3 inches in rows 
spaced 6 to 12 inches apart (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  
Peas emerge in 10 to 14 days.  Spring-planted peas flower 
30 to 50 days after planting, and fall-planted peas flower 
approximately 250 days after planting.  Flowering lasts 2 
to 4 weeks.  The length of the growing season for spring-
planted peas is 60 to 150 days (Elzebroek and Wind, 
2008) and for fall-planted peas, 300 to 320 days (McGee, 
2012). 
 
Management 
Peas grown as commercial crop:  Peas grow well on soils 
with moderate fertility levels, but on soils with low 
fertility, application of 45 lb/ac nitrogen and 90 lb/ac 
phosphorus and potassium can be advantageous 
(Hartmann et al., 1988).  Nutrients applied in excess or at 
the wrong time may promote vegetative growth and be 
detrimental to pod development.  A soil test will provide 
accurate information about nutrients needed. 
 
Fresh and dry peas are mechanically harvested by cutting 
the plants and threshing them to remove the seeds from 
the pods and vines.  Prior to harvesting fresh peas, pea 

 

 

quality and maturity is evaluated with a pressure test 
(Hartmann et al., 1988).  The moisture content of dry peas 
must be less than 13% (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  
Garden peas are also harvested by hand before the seed 
matures for the fresh market.

Peas are poor competitors with weeds.  Rapid seedling 
emergence, adequate crop density, pre- and post-plant 
tillage, and herbicides help reduce weed pressure 
(Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).   
 
Peas grown as green manure or cover crop:  Peas 
produce large amounts of biomass, especially when 
grown in cool temperatures (Clark, 2007).  The biomass, 
however, breaks down very quickly due to the plant’s low 
C:N ratio, and may not improve soil organic matter over 
the long-term (Russell, 1973). The decomposition of pea 
residue can be slowed by growing peas with a grain crop 
(Ranells and Wagger, 1997).  
 
Austrian winter peas can produce 90 to 150 lb/acre 
nitrogen (Clark, 2007). The actual amount of nitrogen 
available for plant uptake depends on timing and method 
of incorporation, soil temperature, moisture, and other 
factors (Sullivan, 2003).   
 
Peas are easily killed with herbicides, mowing, or disking.  
This should be done at full-bloom stage to optimize the N 
contribution (Clark, 2007).   
 
Peas do not suppress weeds as well as other cover crops 
(Clark, 2007).  Weed suppression can be improved by 
growing varieties with long vines (Clark, 2007) and 

 

 

  The short growing season and 

normal leaves (McGee, 2012), and growing with annual 
grains such as wheat, triticale, barley or rye. 
 
Numerous researchers have evaluated peas as a green 
manure or cover crop.  Specific uses and results vary by 
geographic region:   
 
California:
 In the mild-winter areas of California, fall-
planted winter peas produce about twice the amount of 
biomass as spring-planted peas (Clark, 2007).  Austrian 
winter peas planted in the Sacramento Valley in October 
can produce 150 lb/acre nitrogen by early April.    
 
Inland Pacific Northwest:
winter-spring precipitation pattern in the Inland Pacific 
Northwest region limit the use of green manures and 
cover crops.  Austrian winter pea has the greatest 
potential as a green manure or cover crop in this region 
because it can grow in cool temperatures. 
 
Auld et al. (1982) found Austrian winter peas seeded in 
early September produced the highest yields of organic 
matter and vine N compared to other seeding dates.  
Delaying seeding by one month reduced the values by 
50%.  Six spring pea cultivars produced a high organic 
matter yield but matured too late for plow-down in 
dryland conditions.  The authors stated Austrian winter 
pea could produce a minimum of 160 lb/acre vine N. 
 
Murray and Swensen (1985) evaluated the yields of 
Austrian winter pea in monocultures and intercropped 
with 25, 50, and 75% winter wheat or winter barley.  
Winter pea yields with 25% winter cereals were equal to 
or 27% greater than monocropped winter peas.  The 
authors attributed the benefit to the intercropped peas to 
reduced lodging, better light capture, and reduced 
incidence of Sclerotinia infection.       
 
Mahler and Auld (1989) compared N fertilizer equivalent 
values and winter wheat yields following Austrian winter 
pea green manure, Austrian winter pea harvested, summer 
fallow and spring barley in northern Idaho (Table 1).  
They found the agronomic benefit of Austrian winter pea 
harvested was similar to Austrian winter pea green 
manure, but the economic benefit of Austrian winter pea 
harvested was greater because it could be sold as a crop.  
They concluded the rotation with Austrian winter pea 
harvested was the most efficient.

wheat yields following Austrian winter pea green manure, 
Austrian winter pea harvested, summer fallow, and spring 
barley.  From Mahler and Auld (1989). 
 
Mahler and Hemamda (1993) incorporated baled and 
dried residue of Austrian winter pea, alfalfa and wheat at 
rates of 0.45, 0.90, and 1.34 t/acre and compared yields of 
spring wheat the following year. The application of 1.34 
t/acre Austrian winter pea residue resulted in highest 
spring wheat yield.  The N mineralization rate of the peas 
was more than double the rate of alfalfa, evidenced by the 
inorganic N in the soil 10 months after residue 
incorporation.  Approximately 77% of the nitrogen from 
the peas was recovered, 58% by the wheat and 19% by 
the soil. 
 
Peas, alone or in mixtures, are sometimes planted in 
vineyards in the eastern Pacific Northwest to supply 
short-term organic matter and nitrogen (Olmstead, 2006).  
The crop is grown as a winter annual and tilled or mowed 
in the early summer. 
 
Northern Great Plains:  Growers in the northern Great 
Plains sometimes plant legumes such as spring pea, 
Austrian winter pea, or lentils in the place of fallow 
(Clark, 2007).  They manage the legume crop according 
to the growing season precipitation.  If the season has 
below normal precipitation, they terminate the crop early.  
If there is normal precipitation, they terminate the crop 
when 4 inches of soil water remain, and if there is above 
normal precipitation, they allow the crop to mature for 
harvest (Clark, 2007).   When they terminate the crop 
early, it still provides benefits of hay or nitrogen for the 
next crop (Fasching, 2006, as cited by Clark, 2007). 
 
In a study in Alberta, Soon et al. (2005) compared soil 
and plant N with no-till and conventional tillage, and with 
previous crops of red clover green manure, field pea, and 
spring wheat (both harvested).  They found nitrogen 
uptake by wheat was higher with no-till than conventional 
tillage, and was higher when legumes preceded the wheat 
crop.  They attributed this to greater mineralization of 
nitrogen from organic matter and microbial biomass 
during crop growth compared to wheat monoculture.  
 
Central Great Plains: In a study in eastern Colorado, 
legumes crops, such as Austrian winter pea, grown in the 
place of fallow depleted soil water and had detrimental 
effects on wheat yield the following year (Nielsen and 
Vigil, 2005).  This occurred even when the legume crop 
was terminated early.   
 
Northern Midwest:  Austrian winter pea may only be 
useful as a spring cover crop in the northern Midwest.  
Creamer et al. (1997) found it did not overwinter as well 
as other cover crops in an Ohio vegetable production 
system.  Akemo et al. (2000a) evaluated field pea, rye, 
and pea-rye combinations at three different rates as spring 

cover crops in tomato production.  Rye planted at the 
highest 100% rate resulted in the best weed control, 
however tomatoes yielded the highest when planted into 
mixtures containing 50% or more pea (Akemo et al., 
2000b). 
 
Southern Midwest:  In Missouri, Reinbott et al. (2004) 
demonstrated that growing Austrian winter pea as a cover 
crop may provide benefits to no-till corn and grain 
sorghum.  Yields of corn and grain sorghum were highest 
following fall-sown Austrian winter pea and hairy vetch 
when compared to oats, mixtures with oats, and no cover 
crop. 
 
South:  Keeling et al. (1996) compared eight legumes, 
including Austrian winter pea, and two cereals for 
interseeding into cotton to control wind erosion in Texas.  
They found winter pea and hairy vetch established better 
than the small-seeded legumes; however, wheat and rye 
were the most dependable for producing soil cover.   
 
East and Southeast:  Austrian winter pea is considered an 
option for green manure and cover crops in the East and 
Southeast, but the disease Sclerotinia crown rot limits its 
use (Clark, 2007).   
 
Austrian winter pea had better winter survival than 11 
other legumes in a no-till study in Florida, but it was 
damaged by Sclerotinia during damp cool periods 
(Holderbaum et al., 1990).  It did not yield as well as 
hairy vetch, crimson clover, or legume-wheat mixtures.  
 
Carrera et al. (2005) found that Austrian winter pea and 
four other cover crops, alone or in mixtures, had potential 
in potato cropping systems with conservation tillage in 
Maryland and Virginia.  The cover crops and 
conservation tillage provided the ability to enter the field 
earlier, and improved the soil by adding organic matter 
and reducing erosion.  Economic analysis also 
demonstrated these practices were viable. 
 
Bhardwaj (2006) discovered that Austrian winter pea as a 
winter legume cover crop in Virginia resulted in higher 
yields of muskmelon and sweet corn than 102 lb/acre N 
fertilizer and no fertilizer, but lower yields than white 
lupine and hairy vetch.  
 
In Georgia, Schomberg et al. (2006) compared Austrian 
winter pea, three other legumes, oil seed radish, rye and 
black oat for a cover crop with strip till and no-till before 
cotton.  While Austrian winter pea and hairy vetch had 
the highest nitrogen content (71.4 lb/acre), the 
combination of strip-tillage with black oats was the most 
profitable. 

Pests and Potential Problems 
Common foliar pea diseases (and their causal organism) 
include bacterial blight (Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi), 
ascochyta blight (Ascochyta pisi, Mycosphaerella pinodes 

 

 

and Phoma medicaginis var. pinodella), powdery mildew 
(Eryisphe pisi), downy mildew (Peronospora viciae f. sp. 
pisi), septoria blight (Septoria pisi), and white mold 
(Sclerotinia sclerotiorum).  Rhizoctonia (Rhizoctonia 
solani) and Pythium (Pythium spp.) are common seed rot 
and seedling damping-off diseases.  Common root rots 
include Fusarium root rot (Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi), 
Aphanomyces root rot (Aphanomyces euteiches), and 
Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. pisi).  
Economically important pea viral diseases include bean 
yellow mosaic (BYMV), pea enation mosaic (PEMV), 
pea seedborne mosaic virus (PSbMV), red clover vein 
mosaic virus (RCVMV) and pea streak virus (PeSV).   
Insect pests include pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), 
pea leaf miners (Liriomyza huidobrensis), pea leaf 
weevils (Sitona lineatus), pea seed weevils (Bruchus 
pisorum), Lygus bugs (Lygus spp.), spider mites (various 
species), and seed corn maggots (Delia platura).  
Nematodes (various species) can also be problematic in 
local areas (Kraft and Pfleger, 2001; McGee, 2012). 

Environmental Concerns 
None. 

Seeds and Plant Production 
Depending on the cultivar, there can be 1,000 to 3,000 
pea seeds per pound (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  The 
average yields in the U.S. during the years 2007 – 2011 
were:  Austrian winter peas 1,319 lb/acre; dry edible peas 
1,828 lb/acre, and wrinkled peas 616,800 CWT (USDA-
National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2012). 

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Numerous pea cultivars are available.  Breeders have 
selected for height, vegetative growth form, season of 
maturity, disease resistance, pod shape and length, seed 
color, tenderness, sweetness, seed shape, number of seeds 
per pod, and pod production per node (Hartmann et al., 
1988; Elzebroek and Wind, 2008). 
 
Producers in the Palouse region of the Inland Pacific 
Northwest (eastern Washington, northern Idaho and 
northeastern Oregon) grow many different types of peas, 
including the following types and cultivars.  Green field 
peas: ‘Aragorn’, ‘Ariel’, ‘Banner’ and ‘CDC Striker’; 
forage peas: ‘40-10’, ‘Trapper’, ‘CDC Sonata’ and ‘Flex’;  
marrowfat peas (for the snack food market and mushy 
peas in UK): ‘Micichi’, ‘Midlea’, and ‘22-5’;  maple peas 
(racing pigeon food): ‘Courier’, ‘CDC Mosaic’, and 
‘CDC Rocket’ (McGee, 2012). 
 
Producers in Montana, North Dakota, Alberta and 
Saskatchewan primarily grow yellow field peas.  
Cultivars include ‘Bridger’, ‘Delta’, ‘DS Admiral’, 
‘Carousel’, ‘CDC Agassiz’, and ‘Cutlass’ (McGee, 2012). 
 

 

 

Fall-planted field pea cultivars in the Palouse and 
northern Great Plains include ‘Specter’, ‘Windham’, 
‘Whistler’, ‘Granger’ and ‘Melrose’ (McGee, 2012). 
 
Cultivars often planted as green manure or cover crops 
include ‘Granger’, ‘Melrose’, and ‘Magnus’ (Clark, 
2007).
