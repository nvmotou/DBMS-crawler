Tapertip hawksbeard provides fair to very good forage for 
sheep and cattle (Hermann, 1966). Ogle and Brazee 
(2009) rate tapertip hawksbeard as preferred spring and 
summer forage for sheep and desirable spring and 
summer forage for cattle, horses, elk, deer and antelope. 
The leaves contain approximately 30% crude protein, 
0.78% calcium and 0.5% phosphorus (Barnett and 
Crawford, 1994). 
 
Ethnobotany: The Karok Indian Tribe in California pealed 
and ate raw stems of tapertip hawksbeard (Moerman, 
1998).

Description 
General:  Sunflower family (Asteraceae). Tapertip 
hawksbeard is a native perennial forb with one to several 
stems arising from a persistent woody base. Mature plants 
average 25 to 85 cm (10 to 33 in) tall. The basal and 
lower stem leaves are 10 to 40 cm (4 to 16 in) long with 
an elliptic to oblanceolate, pinnatifid to runcinate-
pinnatifid (dandelion shaped) blade. The plants bear 
numerous cylindrical flower heads, each with 5 to 10 
flowers. The flowers bear a 10 to 18 mm (0.4 to 0.7 in) 
long yellow corolla. Tapertip hawksbeard is in the 
cichorieae tribe of the sunflower or composite family. 
Members of this tribe all contain milky juice and bear 
only ray-like flowers with no central disk in the flower 
head. Tapertip hawksbeard is primarily apomictic, 
producing seed asexually (Babcock and Stebbins, 1938).  
 
The fruit is a yellow-tan to dark brown achene, 7 to 9 mm 
(0.28 to 0.35 in) long and 1 to 2 mm (0.04 to 0.08 in) 
wide. Seed counts in the literature vary widely. Barner 
(2007) reported 363,000 seeds/kg (165,000 seeds/lb), 
while the PLANTS database reported 1,760,000 seeds/kg 
(800,000 seeds/lb) (USDA-NRCS, 2011). Seed counts on 
more than 20 accessions conducted by the authors ranged 
from 220,000 to 575,000 seeds/kg (100,000 to 261,000 
seeds/lb).

Uses 
Wildlife: Tapertip hawksbeard leaves are consumed by 
pre-laying sage grouse hens and make up a large portion 
of their diet (Barnett and Crawford, 1994). Sage grouse 
chicks also feed on tapertip hawksbeard leaves in addition 
to the insects attracted by the flowers (Drut and others, 
1994; Klebenow and Gray, 1968).  
 
Although pollinators are not required for tapertip 
hawksbeard to set seed, hawksbeard species attract both 
generalist bees as well as those that specialize on the 
composite family. Bee genera observed foraging on 

 

Pests and Potential Problems 
Tapertip hawksbeard achenes are frequently found 
containing insect larvae. Insect damage can significantly 
reduce seed yields. 

Environmental Concerns 
Tapertip hawksbeard is native to western North America. 
It is a natural component of the native flora and poses no 
environmental concerns. 

Seeds and Plant Production 
Wildland stands of tapertip hawksbeard ripen from mid-
June to mid-July. The presence of the fluffy white pappus 
appears to be a good indication of seed ripeness. 
Harvesting seed prior to pappus expression dramatically 
increases the amount of non-viable seed. Seed can be 
harvested by hand-stripping and with racquets and 
hoppers (Jensen, 2004). 
 
Small seed collections can be cleaned by removing the 
pappus from the achenes using a brush machine with the 
gate closed. Following brushing the seed is cleaned using 
a multi-deck air screen cleaner with a 4 mm hole screen 
on top and a 1.4 mm slot screen on bottom with light air. 
Viability of wildland harvested seed is highly variable. 
 
Seed requires a substantial cold stratification for high 
germination rates. Non-stratified seed yielded 0 to 
11percent germination in trials conducted by the 
Aberdeen Plant Materials Center (St. John, 2001). In an 
unpublished study, highest germination rates 
(approximately 75 %) were obtained from 8 months of 
cold stratification at 1° C in moist peat moss. Seed can be 
sown into greenhouse flats at 0.65 to 1.3 cm (0.25 to 0.50 
in) deep (Rawlins and others, 2009). Transplant success 
with both bareroot and container stock is variable. The 
plants produce a long delicate tap root which is easily 
damaged during transplanting. Years to seed production 
from container stock is unknown. 
 
Tapertip hawksbeard poses numerous problems which 
prevent it from being commercially pursued by the native 
seed industry.  Field establishment is difficult. It takes 
several years for established plants to produce seed and 
the species is prone to substantial seed damage from 
insects. Furthermore, tapertip hawksbeard flowers and 
ripens indeterminately, requiring multiple harvests for 
maximum seed yield. 

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are currently no commercial releases of tapertip 
hawksbeard. Wildland collections are typically not 
available from commercial sources. Contract collection 
for small quantities is possible with costs exceeding $100 
per pound.

Distribution:  Tapertip hawksbeard occurs in all western 
states from California, Oregon and Washington east to 
Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico (USDA-
NRCS, 2011). For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 

Habitat:  This species can be found in dry, open places in 
the foothills and lower elevations in the mountains. It is 
commonly found in basin big sagebrush and mountain big 
sagebrush plant communities, but is also known from 
mountain brush, aspen-fir and spruce-fir communities. 

Adaptation 
Tapertip hawksbeard grows in medium to coarse soils 
with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.8 (Rawlins and others, 2009; 
USDA-NRCS, 2011). It occupies open sites in areas 
receiving 20 to 50 cm (8 to 20 in) annual precipitation at 
elevations from 1,400 to 2,900 m (4,500 to 9,500 ft) 
(Welsh and others, 2003). 

Establishment 
The full seed rate for 25 to 30 pure live seeds (PLS)/ft at 
12 inch row spacing is 7 PLS lb/ac. When planted in a 
mixture, the seeding rate should be adjusted according to 
the desired proportion of the mix. Rangeland seeding 
should take place in the fall to allow the seed to 
overwinter. Seed should be planted to a depth of 0.65 to 
1.3 cm (0.25 to 0.50 in). 
 
Management 
Tapertip hawksbeard should be used as a minor 
component of seed mixtures.  Management should be 
based on the key species in the established plant 
community.  Grazing should be deferred on seeded lands 
for at least two growing seasons to allow for full stand 
establishment. Blaisdell and Mueggler (1956) found that 
2,4-D had little negative effect on tapertip hawksbeard in 
sprayed rangelands.
