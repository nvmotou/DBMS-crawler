Uses 
Wildlife: Waterfowl extensively use and rely on sago 
pondweed as a food source (Kantrud, 1990).  The whole 
plant can be consumed, and parts are utilized by diving, 
dabbling, whistling ducks, many types of geese, swans, 
coots (Kantrud, 1990) and the long-billed dowitcher 
(Sperry, 1940). 
 
Bioremediation and bioindication: May be used to 
suppress phytoplankton blooms by taking up phosphorus 
from the water (Stewart and Davies, 1986).  May also be 
used to monitor heavy metal pollution in rivers (Whitton 
et al., 1981). 
 
Erosion control: The wave dampening action of sago 
pondweed can be used for erosion control of shores and 
dams (Kantrud, 1990). 
 
Status 
Sago pondweed is a threatened plant in New Hampshire.  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Weediness 
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS Web site 
at http://plants.usda.gov.  Please consult the Related Web 
Sites on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
information. 
 
Sago pondweed is considered a nuisance weed or noxious 
weed in some waters that are used for recreational 
purposes (Harrison, 1962; Kantrud, 1990) and irrigation 
canals (Yeo, 1965; Kantrud, 1990). 
 
Description 
General: Pondweed Family (Potomogetonaceae).  Sago 
pondweed is an aquatic herbaceous plant up to 1 m tall 
(Bare, 1979).  Sago pondweed is generally completely 
submersed except the reproductive spike that peaks above 
the water that flowers June – September (Larson, 1993).  
It is nearly unbranched at the base, becoming freely 
branched towards the top (Larson, 1993).  The leaves are 
filiform to threadlike being 2-12 cm long and between 0.2 
- 1.5 cm wide, with stipules fused to the blade being up to 
2/3 as long as the leaf blade (Bare, 1979; Larson, 1993).  
The inflorescence is a spike with 2-6 unevenly spaced

whorls and is 1-5 cm long (Bare, 1979).  Fruits are 
yellowish to brown, ovoid, with a beak 0.3-0.5 mm long 
(Larson, 1993). 
 
Distribution:  Sago pondweed has a nearly worldwide 
distribution (Kantrud, 1990) and is native to most of 
Canada and all of the United States, except Hawaii.  It 
occurs circumboreally to 70˚ N latitude and is found in 
South Africa, South America, South Eurasia, and New 
Zealand (Kantrud, 1990). 
 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat: Sago pondweed is common in shallow to 
moderately deep (<2.5 m), fresh to subsaline permanent 
water bodies where water is absent for not more than 3 
months (Coetzer, 1987; Kantrud, 1990).  Sago pondweed 
can be found in nearly all bottom substrates (Kantrud, 
1990). 
 
Adaptation 
Sago pondweed occurs nearly worldwide and is found 
submerged in semi-permanent to permanently flooded 
areas where the water is less than 2.5 m deep and the flow 
is less than 1 m/s (Kantrud, 1990).  It can be found from 
sea level to almost 4,900 m above sea level (Ascherson 
and Graebener, 1907, citied in Yeo, 1965 and Kantrud, 
1990).  Sago pondweed can grow in nearly all bottom 
substrates and can tolerate high salinity, pH, and alkaline 
water (Kantrud, 1990).  It does not grow well in waters 
with high turbidity (Kantrud, 1990). 
 
Establishment 
Sago pondweed can be cultured in liquid media for 
experimental purposes from druplets, turions, rhizomes, 
leafy tops, or cuttings.  This method eliminates 
uncontrolled variables that can be introduced from the 
substrate or soil in which sago pondweed would normally 
be grown (Kantrud, 1990). 
Druplets can be stored in wet or dry conditions.  
However, to break the dormancy it is best to store in 
water at temperatures just above freezing when using 
plant materials that were collected in temperate regions 
(Kantrud, 1990).  McAtee (1911) suggested planting 
druplets immediately after harvest or removal from 
storage, but Van Wijk (1983) indicated that the best 
germination (about 40%) could be accomplished by 
drying druplets for three months in sediment, then 
ripening them for 14 months in tap water at room 
temperature, and then placing them in freshwater. 
 
Turions can be harvested and stored for a period of up to 
four years, if dipped in paraffin (Yeo, 1965).  Turions can 
also be stored in water at low temperatures or packed in 
layers of straw or moss (Kantrud, 1990).  
 

 

 

Management 
Managers have tried to manipulate populations of sago 
pondweed for use by waterfowl and wildlife by adjusting 
the water levels.  However, results from these trials are 
variable and depend on water chemistry, water levels, 
geography, and other macrophyte competitors (Kantrud, 
1990).  In some cases, declines in populations have been 
achieved by partially dewatering of the pools. In other 
instances, an increase in sago pondweed was observed by 
partially or fully dewatering the pools (Kantrud, 1990).  
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Although not conclusive, there are bacteria and fungi that 
may cause diseases in sago pondweed and could be 
responsible for a decline in sago populations or 
deformities of the plants.  The specific species that have 
been implicated include Rhizoctonia solani, Tetramyxa 
parasitica, Pythium spp., Curvularia sp., Phoma sp., 
Pullularia pullulans, and Hyaloflorae sp.  While these 
species have been implicated, it has not been concluded 
that these pathogens are the cause of the decline or that 
sago pondweed is necessarily susceptible to these diseases 
(Kantrud, 1990). 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Sago pondweed has been considered a noxious weed in 
waters used for recreational purposes and irrigation. Sago 
can physically obstruct recreational activities and water 
flow. Sago may also become a substrate that allows 
nuisance algae to attach.  Sago may also cause very low 
 in streams used to move sewage effluent 
levels of O2
(Madsen et al., 1988).  Dense formations of sago beds 
may also limit movement of predator fish and inhibit 
fishing (Engel, 1984).  It has also been documented that 
sago pondweed can clog water intake ports at power 
plants (Peltier and Welch, 1969). 
 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Some of the chemicals 
mentioned may not be safe or legal for use in aquatic 
environments.  Always read label and safety instructions 
for each control method.  Trade names and control 
measures appear in this document only to provide specific 
information.  USDA NRCS does not guarantee or 
warranty the products and control methods named, and 
other products may be equally effective.   
 
Chemical: Many herbicides and chemicals have been used 
to attempt to control growth or numbers of sago 
pondweed.  For specific information on the rates and use 
of each chemical mentioned please refer to the associated 
reference and the label instructions.  
 
Commercial fertilizers have been recommended to 
increase phytoplankton in water thus reducing water 
clarity and preventing sago pondweed invasion (Walker, 
1959; Kantrud, 1990).  Established stands of sago 

pondweed have been controlled by using 2,4D granules, 
silvex, and sodium arsenite (Davison et al., 1962; Kantrud 
1990).  Copper sulfate, diquat, fenac, dichlobenil, 
naptalum, morflurazon, aquathol-K, aquizine, ortho 
diquat, 2,4D butoxethanol ester, atrazine, glycophosphate, 
triazine, carbofuran, and alachlor have been used to 
control or inhibit sago pondweed targeting various parts 
of the plant (Kantrud, 1990). 
 
Physical and Biological: Mechanical and physical 
removal and control of sago pondweed by using rakes, 
cables, mechanical harvesters, and light exclusion have 
been used but have had limited or no success and are not 
economically feasible (Kantrud, 1990; Mitzner, 1978; 
Gangstad, 1976; Mayhew and Runkel, 1962; Engel, 
1984). 
 
Using other vascular plants to prevent the establishment 
of sago pondweed has been suggested by Yeo (1976) and 
Madsen (1986).   Animal control of sago pondweed has 
been tried using the burrowing chrysomelid beetle, 
Haemonia appendiculata (Donaciinae) (Grillas, 1988; 
Kantrud, 1990), and the grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon 
idella (Kantrud, 1990).  However, using these animals did 
not obtain the control of sago pondweed that was desired. 
 
Seeds and Plant Production 
Druplets can be broadcast seeded into shallow water, less 
than 2 meters, however, the best establishments have been 
by imbedding druplets, turions, or plant tops in clay and 
dropping them from boats in the spring (Kantrud, 1990).  
A planting rate of 3,000 plant parts per hectare is 
recommended and stands are not likely to be very robust 
until the second season after root systems have developed 
(Kantrud, 1990).  Sago pondweed does not compete well 
with other macrophyte competitors such as Myriophyllum, 
Ceratophyllum, Ruppia, and Chara.  Water chemistry 
should also be monitored, as sago pondweed does best in 
waters with salinity between 5-15 g/L. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Theses plant materials are somewhat readily available 
from commercial sources.  There are no known cultivars, 
improved, or selected materials at this time.
