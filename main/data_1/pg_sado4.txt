leaves to apply to the chest, smoked dried leaves and 
made steam baths with the leaves to ease congestion.  
Infusions, decoctions, washes and poultices of this 
plant were also used to treat headaches, 
stomachaches, fever, influenza, pneumonia, 
gonorrhea, swollen leg veins, eye problems and 
general illness (Native American Ethnobotany 
Database 2010).  The Hopi used smoke and an 
infusion of the plant to alleviate epilepsy and 
faintness and the Kawaiisu threw the plant into fire to 
keep away spirits and ghosts (Native American 
Ethnobotany Database 2010).   The Hopi, Kumiai, 
and Paipai also used the plant to treat stomachaches, 
headaches and other medical conditions (Huisinga 
2001). 
 
Status 
Salvia dorrii ssp. mearnsii is listed by the United 
States Forest Service as a sensitive species in Arizona 
due to its limited distribution and threats to its 
survival (Huisinga 2001).  Consult the PLANTS Web 
site and your State Department of Natural Resources 
for this plant’s current status (e.g., threatened or 
endangered species, state noxious status, and wetland 
indicator values).

Description 
General:  Mint family (Lamiaceae).  Salvia dorrii is a 
woody perennial shrub that grows to 20 to 80 cm (8 
to 32 in) tall and 20 to 150 cm (24 to 36 in) wide.  It 
has an upright to spreading form, with the exception 
of S. dorrii ssp. dorrii var. clokeyi  which forms mats 
and occasionally roots at the nodes (Strachan 1982).  
The plant has rough bark that peels off the mature 
woody branches.  Leaves are opposite, oval, 1.5 to 4 
cm (0.6 to 1.6 in) long, 0.5 to 1.5 cm (0.2 to 0.6 in) 
wide, are widest at the tip and taper to the stem.  
Leaves have a smooth margin, are silver-gray,

Alternate Names 
Dorr sage, Grayball sage, desert sage, tobacco sage  
 
Uses 
Ornamental:  Purple sage is an attractive, low-
maintenance, drought-tolerant shrub that can be used 
as an accent plant or small hedge in landscaped areas 
(Mee et al. 2003).  It will maintain its rounded shape 
without pruning (Mee et al. 2003) and is resistant to 
browsing by deer and rabbits (High Country Gardens 
2010). 
 
Pollinators: Purple sage provides nectar and pollen 
for bees, butterflies and moths. 
 
Range revegetation: This plant can be used for 
revegetation and diversification of rangeland, 
particularly in harsh, rocky sites. 

Forage:  Purple sage is undesirable as forage to both 
livestock and wildlife. 
 
Ethnobotanical:  This plant was used for multiple 
medicinal and cultural purposes by tribes throughout 
its range.  People of the Kawasiiu, Paiute, Shoshoni, 
Washoe and Okanagan-Colville tribes made infusions 
and decoctions of the leaves and stems of purple sage 
for a cold remedy.  They also made poultices of the 

 

aromatic, and are retained on the plant throughout the 
winter months.  The plant blooms in spring through 
early summer (May through July). Flower bracts are 
broad, about 1 cm (0.4 in) wide and are reddish 
purple. Flowers are pale blue to purple, 1 to 1.3 cm 
(0.4 to 0.5 in) long, and occur in a series of showy, 
terminal clusters. The corolla is two-lipped, with the 
three-lobed bottom lip longer than the flat, two-lobed 
upper lip.  The two stamens extend beyond the 
corolla. The style is narrow, long and two-parted.  
The ovary is two-celled and superior.  Four seeds are 
produced per flower, and they are thick-walled 
achenes (Hitchcock and Cronquist 1973; Strachan 
1982; Knopf  2001; Mee et al. 2003; Burke Museum 
of Natural History and Culture 2010).

The first recorded collections of Salvia dorrii were 
made by David Douglas in Washington state “… on 
the banks of the Columbia, near the Priest’s Rapid, 
and on the clayey banks near the Big Birch, in 1826” 
(Lindley 1831, as referenced by Strachan 1982).   
Doulgas named the plant “Salvia carnosa” at that 
time, but never published the name.   The first 
published name of the plant was Audibertia incana 
Benth., in 1831.  The name later transitioned to 
Audibertia dorri Kellogg in 1863, and to Salvia dorri 
(Kellogg) Abrams in 1951 (Strachan 1982). 
 
The genus name Salvia is derived from the Latin 
salveo which means “I am well” (Charters 2010).  
The species name dorrii refers to Clarendon Herbert 
Dorr (1816 – 1887) who was a poet, inventor, and 
son of the captain of the first American ship to 
anchor in a California port (Charters 2010).  C.H. 
Dorr purportedly made collections of this plant near 
Virginia City, Nevada in the mid 1800s (Strachan 
1982). 
 
Distribution:  Salvia dorrii is found throughout the 
western United States (Utah, Nevada, Idaho, 
Washington, Oregon, California, and Arizona).  The 
taxon is currently divided into two subspecies:  S. 

 

 

dorrii ssp. dorrii and S. dorrii ssp. mearnsii.  Within 
S. dorrii ssp. dorrii there are four varieties 
(ecotypes): clokeyi (found in Nevada), dorrii (found 
in Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Nevada, California, and 
Arizona), incana (found in California, Oregon, 
Washington and Idaho), and pilosa (found in 
California, Nevada and Arizona).  S. dorrii ssp. 
mearnsii is endemic to Arizona.  For current 
distribution, consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat: Purple sage grows in sandy, rocky or 
limestone soil on dry open slopes, on flats or foothills 
(Burke Museum of Natural History and Cutlure 2010; 
Huisinga 2001).  It is often associated with pinyon-
juniper, sagebrush, chaparral, and cool desert shrub 
habitats (Knopf 2001; Mee et al. 2003; Huisinga 
2001). 
  
Adaptation 
Purple sage is adapted to  areas receiving 18 to 38 cm 
(7 to 15 in) of annual precipitation, at elevations 
ranging from 300 to 3,050 m (960 to 9,800 ft). 
 
Establishment 
Purple sage can be established by seed or 
transplanted seedlings.  Seeds should be planted in a 
late fall dormant planting (November or December) 
with a drill into a weed-free seedbed at a rate of 5.6 
kilograms PLS (pure live seed) per hectare (5 pounds 
PLS per acre) and at a depth of 1.3 – 0.6 cm (0.5 – 
0.25 in).  If included in a mix the seeding rate should 
be adjusted accordingly, and if the seed is broadcast 
the rate should be doubled.  Stratification in cold and 
moist conditions will enhance germination (Love 
1994).       
 
Seedlings can be started by seed or semi-hardwood 
cuttings during the fall to winter months, grown out 
in greenhouse and transplanted in the early spring 
(March – May depending on frost risk).  Semi-
hardwood cuttings are from leafy, matured annual or 
secondary growth (Everett 1978).  Transplanted 
seedlings should be spaced 0.6 – 0.9 m (2 to 3 ft) 
apart. 

Management 
Salvia dorrii produces new branches each season 
throughout the spring, summer and early fall.  Most 
of the new growth dies back in the winter, though 
some persists and becomes woody (Strachan 1982).  
For this reason pruning of Salvia dorrii is not 
necessary in order to increase the number of 
flowering branches.  Pruning the lateral branches, 
however, may encourage a more upright form to 
facilitate machine harvesting.  This method has not 
been tested. 
 
Salvia dorrii  may not be suitable for sprinkler-
irrigated production.  Only 60% of transplanted 

seedlings under solid-set irrigation at the Washington 
State University Experiment Station in Othello, WA, 
survived into their second year.  The plants received 
a maximum of 2.5 cm (1 in) of water per week during 
the months of May, June and July.  Excessive 
moisture in combination with an unsuitable soil type 
(silt loam) may have caused the plant mortality.   
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
The Pullman Plant Materials Center has found a large 
portion (>50%) of harvested seed damaged by insect 
predation.  The damaged seed can be separated from 
intact seed with the use of a forced air column 
following screen cleaning.   
 
Environmental Concerns 
None. 

Seeds and Plant Production 
Salvia dorrii has about 530,000 seeds per kilogram 
(240,000 seeds per pound) (Royal Botanic Gardens 
Kew, Seed Information Database 2008).  Seeds can 
be easily separated from plant material with use of a 
hammer mill and screen cleaner.  As mentioned 
above, the Pullman Plant Materials Center has found 
a large portion of harvested seed damaged by insects.  
A forced air column following screen cleaning can 
remove the damaged seed. 
 

Germination of Salvia dorrii seed is enhanced with 1 
to 6 weeks of cold-moist stratification or treatment 
with gibberellic acid (GA3) (Love 1994).  
Germination rates are also higher with fluctuating 
diurnal temperatures as opposed to constant 
temperatures (Love 1994) and low water levels (10 
ml per day) as opposed to high (50 ml per day) 
(Huisinga 2001).  Scarification does not enhance 
germination of Salvia dorrii ssp. dorrii (Love 1989) 
or Salvia dorri ssp. mearnsii (Huisinga 2001).  Kay et 
al. (1988) evaluated seed stored in open warehouse 
and hermetically sealed conditions over a period of 7 
years.  They found viability declined immediately 
when stored in an open warehouse, declined after 2 
years when stored sealed at -15C, and remained 
constant or improved when stored sealed at 4C and at 
room temperature.  
 
Plants of Salvia dorrii establish and grow quickly.   
The Pullman Plant Materials Center has observed 
transplanted one-year-old seedlings under irrigation 
produced seed during the first year, and of the 60% of 
plants that survived into the second year, seed 
production increased.   

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
None.  However seedlings are commercially 
available from several nurseries in western  
states.  Seed availability is extremely limited.
